Season 1 (2010–11)
The first season premiered on October 20, 2010 with the two-part episode "Breakout", continuing on from the events of the online micro-series. This move meant that the series did not air on television in chronological story order; the broadcast of "Breakout" was followed by the episodes "Iron Man is Born", "Thor the Mighty", "Hulk Versus the World", "Meet Captain America", and "The Man in the Ant Hill", each one a compilation of four micro-series episodes, which all take place before "Breakout".[5] The series took a hiatus after "The Kang Dynasty" and returned on May 15, 2011 in the United States.

The series was broadcast around the world and released on DVD in the correct chronological story order (production order). The season finale debuted in Australia on April 12, 2011, then aired on June 26, 2011 in the United States. The first half of Season 1 was released on home video on April 26, 2011,[8] and the second half was released on October 25, 2011.[6]

The Avengers must bring forth an army of nearly all their allies to face their greatest challenge yet - Galactus, the devourer of countless worlds and civilizations, and his quartet of heralds drawn from the very elements of nature. Galactus first sends forth his heralds to oversee the construction of devices around the world to aid him in consuming Earth. Terrax is sent to New York City, while Airwalker is sent to a polar region, Stardust to the middle of an unspecified ocean, and Firelord to an active volcano. The Avengers then call their allies, splitting up into five different teams. Terrax is engaged by Captain America, Iron Fist, Spider-Man, War Machine, and Quake; he is disarmed by Spider-Man before being defeated by the former two and his device destroyed by the latter two. Airwalker is engaged by Thor, Vision, Falcon, Luke Cage, and Black Widow; he is defeated by Vision after Thor heavily weakens him while his device is destroyed by explosives planted by the latter two as Falcon aids their escape. Stardust is engaged by Human Torch, Wasp, Hawkeye, Wolverine and Thing; she is defeated after Human Torch stuns her with a stream of fire and Wasp destroys her from the inside out, with her device being destroyed by several explosive arrows from Hawkeye. Firelord is engaged by Scott Lang, Black Panther, Hulk, Bucky Barnes, and Invisible Woman; under Black Panther's leadership, Invisible Woman greatly depowers Firelord by depriving him of oxygen before Hulk thunderclaps Firelord, dissipating him. Firelord's device is subsequently destroyed by Bucky's rocket launcher. Meanwhile, Iron Man, Ms. Marvel, Reed Richards, Hank Pym, and Doc Samson infiltrate Galactus's ship, but their plan is ruined after Hank Pym attempts to shrink Galactus. Galactus then attempts to destroy the planet himself, and is stopped by a combined effort from multiple Avengers, pushing him into a portal to the Negative Zone where he can consume energy forever.

Introducing characters: Galactus, Heralds of Galactus (Air-Walker, Firelord, Stardust, Terrax)

NOTE: Almost every heroic character that appeared in the series reappears in this episode, with the exception of Mockingbird, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and the Asgardians.
