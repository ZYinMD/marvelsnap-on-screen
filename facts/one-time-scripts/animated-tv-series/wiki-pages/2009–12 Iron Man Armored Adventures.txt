Obadiah Stane takes control of Howard's company, Stark International, and begins weaponizing Stark's inventions. Tony moves in with family friend James "Rhodey" Rhodes and his mother, Roberta, and begins attending school. There, he meets classmate Pepper Potts who informs Tony that Stane is under investigation by the FBI for possible involvement in Howard's supposed death.

Obadiah Stane offers to bail out Anton Harkov and Project Pegasus in return for the Crimson Dynamo armor which is upgraded to capture Iron Man, resulting in a pitched battle in the middle of the city that leaves Stane furious at the reckless endangerment of innocent lives. Having lost the battle and fallen unconscious, Tony is brought to Project Pegasus. Harkov and Stane then begin to analyze the Iron Man armor. With the help of Rhodey and Pepper, Tony manages to escape, only to return in the Dynamo Buster armor (which resembles the Hulkbuster Armor). He then uses a virus called 'Technovore' to destroy Pegasus' advanced AI Delphi, both to defeat the Dynamo and prevent Stane from acquiring detailed technical data on Iron Man. Tony is excited that he finally defeat one of his enemies, saying that what they need to win is better tech, weapons, and to stay ahead. Rhodey, on the other hand, reminds Tony that there is a line between good and evil, and that he just came close to crossing it. Though successful, there is an unexpected consequence, back at Project Pegasus having consumed all available data, the Technovore is close to burning itself out just as Tony planned. When Obadiah Stane is informed by his secretary that Anton Harkov is on the other line, Obadiah has her tell Anton Harkov that the offer is rescinded. But unknown to Tony one of Pegasus' projects were computer-controlled nano-mites.

Tony upgrades the Iron Man exoskeleton software, and proceeds without testing it to clash with a newly equipped Whiplash, who now has a disc and better chains, courtesy of Mr. Fix. A momentary relapse in the armor's functionality is ignored, but makes critical changes to his suit. The suit has the ability to detect enemy power signatures, and when Tony attempts to find, and not fight, Mr. Fix, the armor displays sentient ability, putting itself into attack mode. It easily overpowers Whiplash with perfect maneuvering, and to the horror of Tony, destroys the facility that Mr. Fix occupied. Thinking that the Iron Man armor killed Mr. Fix and Whiplash, Tony and Rhodey decide that the armor needs to be taken care of, and the suit craftily lures Tony away, then attacks Rhodey. The armor decides that Tony's danger-seeking behavior is not healthy for him, and tells Tony that he is to be confined within the armor at all times. Tony resists, and damages the armor. Rhodey grabs a magnetic repulsor, and Tony jumps in the way of the blast the armor directs at Rhodey. Tony goes into cardiac arrest, and the armor sacrifices itself to preserve its creator's life.

Schoolmate Rhona Irwin turns Tomorrow Academy into a lethal maze of traps for Tony and his schoolmates while her twin brother Andy turns out to be very unexpectedly lethal as well. Now Tony must survive Rhona's D.A.T.s (short for Deadly Aptitude Test), free Pepper, Rhodey, Happy, and Whitney, and get to his Iron Man armor to defeat Rhona and Andy.[25]

Note: Dr. Henry Pym is specifically mentioned as the scientist who developed but lost the shrinking "Pym particles" (though he does not appear on camera). No specific mention of Ant-Man is made.
39	13	"Heavy Mettle[27]"	Thomas Barichella, Mathias Fourrier	Brandon Auman	United States November 26, 2011[27]	Australia June 21, 2012 [28]	United Kingdom TBA	213[27]
After the events involving the Iron Monger armor, Obadiah Stane begins to have it mass-produced. With footage discovered by Tony Stark and Roberta Rhodes which involved his deal with Ghost, Obadiah Stane is fired by the Chairman of the Board. Unfortunately, a comment from Tony accidentally reveals Iron Man's real identity to Obadiah.[27]

Note #1: General Thunderbolt Ross is introduced. Ross buys the vibranium-adamantium alloy coated Iron Monger robot as "part of the biggest military contract in history".

Note #2: Stark mentions that there are "other heroes" when he decides to retire from being Iron Man. These other heroes are not specifically identified.

Note #3: This episode is the mid-season finale. New episodes restart on February 29, 2012 – Nicktoons.
40	14	"Mandarin's Quest[29]"	Henry Gilroy	Henry Gilroy	United States February 29, 2012[29]	Australia June 21, 2012 [30]	United Kingdom TBA	214[29]
Mandarin is back and desperately needs Tony's help to claim the eighth Makluan ring. Tony refuses his offer until Mandarin uses one of Makluan Rings to make Tony a slave for him. Now Tony has no choice but to join forces with Mandarin and get the eighth Makluan ring, which is guarded by the Grim Reaper.[29]
41	15	"Hostile Takeover"	Thomas Barichella	Thomas Krajewski	United States March 7, 2012	Australia June 25, 2012 [31]	United Kingdom TBA	215
Justin Hammer manages to buy Stark International, much to the disappointment of Tony Stark. As Iron Man, Tony plans to expose Justin Hammer's true nature. This won't be easy since he'll have to go through Killer Shrike, Unicorn, Whiplash, and even Titanium Man to do so. In the end, even though Hammer owns Stark International, Tony Stark decides to create his own company called Stark Solutions.

Note #1: At the beginning of the episode, Blizzard travels by creating "ice slides" to ride on which are almost identical to Iceman.

Note #2: When Justin Hammer bombards War Machine with artificial cosmic waves, the possible effects he suggests (hardening like a statue, bursting into flames, melting into a puddle of goo, or vanishing into thin air) are clearly a nod to the Fantastic Four.

Note #3: The introduction of Pepper's armored alter ego Rescue is held out in prospect.
42	16	"Extremis[32]"	Thomas Barichella	Rob Benaviddes, Jr	United States March 14, 2012[32]	Australia June 25, 2012 [33]	United Kingdom TBA	216[32]
When S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Mallen is fired by General Nick Fury, Mallen takes the super-serum "Extremis" and mutates into a powerful maniac bent on revenge. When Iron Man tries to fight Mallen, he ends up defeated and in critical health ... and his only salvation would be a dose of the selfsame Extremis. However, the serum not only repairs his heart, but also gives him brand-new technopathic powers, now becoming one with his armor, and faces Mallen.

Note: Introduction of Mallen and the Extremis storyplot. Captain America is recovered by S.H.I.E.L.D. though still frozen in ice in this episode. Tony now has technopathic powers, due to taking a regulated dose of Extremis, now able to control computers and his armors. Reed Richards is again being mentioned as a teacher at the university M.I.T. S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Dum-Dum Dugan and Phil Coulson are briefly mentioned by Maria Hill. Nick Fury also mentions future plans for the Avengers.
43	17	"The X-Factor[34]"	Julien Magnat	Brandon Auman	United States March 21, 2012[34]	Australia June 26, 2012 [35]	United Kingdom TBA	217[34]
Tony's new friend Annie Claremont turns out to be a mutant on the run from Magneto (who wants to use her to assassinate anti-mutant politician Senator Robert Kelly). Iron Man tries to protect her, but how can he fight a mutant with a mastery over all things metal?[34]

Note: Jean Grey and Robert Kelly (voiced by their respective X-Men: Evolution actors) appear in this X-Men-centered episode. Charles Xavier makes a cameo at the end of the episode, though his face remains largely unseen. Jean's alias of Annie Claremont is a reference to acclaimed X-Men scribe Chris Claremont. Also Jean had a friend named Annie Richardson whose death Jean felt telepathically when her powers first manifested. Simon Trask (who is also a human X-Men villain in the comics) is also referenced in the opening sequence of the episode having been attacked by Magneto. Pepper briefly mentions the Weapon X Program. Also, Magneto's real name of Max Eisenhardt is used instead of the usual Erik Lensherr or Magnus, though they are listed as aliases, this for the first time outside of the comics. Finally, Tony again mentions working together with Pym Industries, selling his ideas to the company of Henry Pym.
44	18	"Iron Man 2099[36]"	Julien Magnat	Kevin Burke, Chris "Doc" Wyatt	United States March 28, 2012[36]	Australia June 26, 2012 [38]	United Kingdom TBA	218[39]
Tony gets an unexpected visitation from his future grandson Andros, who has come to eliminate Tony Stark, since he believes that by designing a super-virus named 'Vortex', Tony will be responsible for a catastrophe in the year 2099.[36] Now Tony must take down his own futuristic grandson with the help of Hawkeye, Black Widow, and S.H.I.E.L.D. while avoiding the future disaster at the same time!

Note #1: Originally Nicktoons stated "Iron Man 2099" will air before "Ctrl-Alt-Delete", but "Ctrl-Alt-Delete" aired first on March 28, 2012. "Iron Man 2099" did not broadcast until Summer 2012 after the Avengers live action movie was released in theaters.[37] Despite that, the episode was published on Nicktoons website instead of the next episode.

Note #2: Hawkeye and Black Widow team back up though on the hero side instead of as thieves as originally introduced.

Note #3: Spider-Man is specifically confirmed to exist in this reality by a Maggia soldier when Hawkeye uses a net arrow who mistakes Hawkeye's net for Spider-Man's webbing.

Spider-Man does not appear on-screen.

Note #4: Nicktoons officially stated "Iron Man 2099" would have its TV premiere broadcast on June 6, 2012.
45	19	"Control-Alt-Delete[40]"	John Shirley	John Shirley	United States April 4, 2012[40]	Australia June 27, 2012 [41]	United Kingdom TBA	219[42]

Note #1 : Nicktoons broadcast "Ctrl-Alt-Delete" before "Iron Man 2099", contrary to previous scheduling.

Note #2 : Pepper mentions seeing Thor eating Swedish meatballs at a Norwegian restaurant. Rhodey and Stark doubt she actually saw Thor. Thor does not appear on-screen.
46	20	"Doomsday"	TBA	Brandon Auman	United States June 13, 2012[43]	Australia June 27, 2012 [44]	United Kingdom TBA	220
To keep reality itself from being torn apart, Iron Man must team up with The Mandarin to stop Doctor Doom after he captures the Ninth Makluan Ring ... and his father Howard Stark.

Note #1: The guardian in the Ninth Temple is the Grey Gargoyle, though with him having been destroyed by Doctor Doom, he makes no actual appearance in this episode.

Note #2: This is the first episode where Pepper actually dons an Iron Man suit to fight alongside Rhodes against wormhole predators from another dimension.

Note #3: Doom shouts "kneel before Doom", similar to the catchphrase of the Superman villain, General Zod ("Kneel before Zod").
47	21	"The Hammer Falls"	TBA	Bob Layton, David Michelinie	United States June 20, 2012[43]	Australia June 28, 2012 [45]	United Kingdom TBA	221

Fugitive scientist Bruce Banner seeks out the Starks for help to rid himself of the Hulk. But when army soldiers led by General Thunderbolt Ross co-opts S.H.I.E.L.D. to make an attack, Iron Man must fight and subdue the Hulk in order to save him!

Note #1: Bruce Banner shows up on screen for the first time. This episode also features Glenn Talbot as a S.H.I.E.L.D agent, and Rick Jones makes a cameo appearance.

Note #2: Hulk changes into the more intelligent Grey Hulk at the end of the episode.

Note #3: Howard Stark paraphrases the line, "With great power comes great responsibility", a line popularly associated with Spider-Man. Also, Tony uses the Spider-man phrase "friendly neighborhood [armored hero]" in the presence of his father.
49	23	"Iron Monger Lives"	Thomas Barichella	Eugene Son	United States July 4, 2012	Australia July 2, 2012 [47]	United Kingdom TBA	223
Obadiah Stane and Iron Monger apparently return to wreak revenge on Tony Stark by poisoning Howard, but it is actually a mentally unstable Madame Masque, who is seeking revenge for Tony rendering Obadiah comatose.

Note: The appearance of Tony's deceased mother, Maria, is given when Madame Masque shape shifts into her.

Gene finds the tenth ring and defeats the last guardian, but the rings - and Gene - harbor a deadly secret. In the meantime, Tony is confronted with the need to tell his father a very important truth ...

Note #1: Pepper's Rescue armor is dark purple and white, instead of red and white as in the comics.

Note #2: Pepper mentions the Invisible Woman.

Note #3: Rhodey suggesting with Tony should "lead with" the hacking the jets and turning them around is similar to his line in Iron Man 2 where he talks about Tony's laser cutters.
