Just as the Watcher has warned, Galactus has arrived at Zenn-La to consume its energy.
 Norrin Radd sacrifices himself by offering to serve as Galactus' herald, whose job it will be to scout out planets without intelligent life so that Galactus won't destroy any civilizations.
 On the upside, Galactus gives Norrin a portion of his powers, turning him into the Silver Surfer.
 With no memories, the Silver Surfer finds world after world for Galactus to devour, but the herald is troubled by the destruction.
 The evil Thanos uses Ego the Living Planet to invade the Surfer's mind, intent on finding the secrets of Galactus within.
 The resulting mental battle unleashes the Surfer's memories and he goes to confront Galactus.
 When Galactus decides to attack the Earth, the Surfer rebels, attacking the world-eater.
 Although the Surfer cannot harm Galactus, he is allowed to return to Zenn-La.

Silver Surfer, also known as Silver Surfer: The Animated Series, is a 13-episode animated television series based on the Marvel Comics superhero Silver Surfer, created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby.
[2]

Overview
Blending cel-shaded and computer animation, the series is rendered in the style of Silver Surfer creator Jack Kirby.
[3]

Inspired by various Silver Surfer comic book stories, the series alters the original mythos in some key ways.
 In this version, the Silver Surfer, who has had the memories of Norrin Radd partially restored to him by Thanos, protects Earth from the hunger of Galactus because it reminds him of Zenn-La.
 As with many Silver Surfer comic book stories, episodes tackle a range of social and political issues, including imperialism, slavery, non-violence, and environmental degradation.
