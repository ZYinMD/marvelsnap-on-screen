 Beau Weaver, Lori Alan, and Chuck McCann were replaced by Cam Clarke, Gail Matthius, and Patrick Pinney as Mister Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, and the Thing respectively, and Doctor Doom was voiced by veteran voice actor Tom Kane for parts 2 and 3.

Galactus
-------------
 For instance, this series stayed true to the original comic book story that recounted the Silver Surfer and Galactus' coming to Earth in a two-part episode as well as Doctor Doom's theft of the Surfer's powers.
"

In "The Silver Surfer & the Coming of Galactus", the Silver Surfer, Firelord, and Terrax fight the Fantastic Four while Galactus attempts to feed on Earth.
 In the episode "When Calls Galactus", Terrax is killed/turned into a worm and Nova (Frankie Raye) becomes the new herald of Galatcus.
 In the aforementioned episode "Silver Surfer and the Return of Galactus", Doom steals the Silver Surfer's powers and tries to steal Galactus' powers, only to be thwarted by the planet devourer himself.


In "To Battle the Living Planet," the Fantastic Four ask Galactus' help in confronting Ego the Living Planet.
 In "To Battle the Living Planet," the Fantastic Four help him fight Ego the Living Planet even when they enlist Galactus' help.
 In "When Calls Galactus," he and Ghost Rider (he uses the penance stare, so it is more likely it is the Daniel Ketch version instead of the Johnny Blaze version) both help the Fantastic Four fight Galactus.
 Also in "When Calls Galactus", Nova volunteers to replace the treacherous Terrax as Galactus' herald.
 He once again tries to go after Galactus, only to hit the barrier that prevents the Silver Surfer from leaving Earth.

 The episode seems to place this show in the same continuity with the Fantastic Four cartoon of the same decade, as this episode plays off the Hulk's appearance in the other show.
 In the episode, Mister Fantastic and the other Fantastic Four take their vacation prior to Hulk, She-Hulk, and Thing fighting Leader's Gamma Soldiers.
 Meanwhile, She-Hulk flirts with Thing, but Ben chooses to rekindle his relationship with Alicia Masters.
 Tataranowicz also wanted to bring Medusa and She-Hulk into the mix as part of the Fantastic Four.

 In the episode, Mister Fantastic and the other Fantastic Four take their vacation prior to Hulk, She-Hulk, and Thing fighting Leader's Gamma Soldiers.
 Meanwhile, She-Hulk flirts with Thing, but Ben chooses to rekindle his relationship with Alicia Masters.

Silver Surfer
-------------
 For instance, this series stayed true to the original comic book story that recounted the Silver Surfer and Galactus' coming to Earth in a two-part episode as well as Doctor Doom's theft of the Surfer's powers.
"

In "The Silver Surfer & the Coming of Galactus", the Silver Surfer, Firelord, and Terrax fight the Fantastic Four while Galactus attempts to feed on Earth.
 By season 2 however, all but the presence of Silver Surfer in that battle is ignored as Terrax is seen again and referred to as being the replacement for the Silver Surfer.
 In the aforementioned episode "Silver Surfer and the Return of Galactus", Doom steals the Silver Surfer's powers and tries to steal Galactus' powers, only to be thwarted by the planet devourer himself.
 He once again tries to go after Galactus, only to hit the barrier that prevents the Silver Surfer from leaving Earth.

Thanos
-------------
 The line included the main characters and many of the various guest-stars, as well as characters that never even appeared on the show, such as Dragon Man and Thanos.

-------------
The Thing
-------------


In the two-part premiere "The Origin of the Fantastic Four", Puppet Master took control of the Thing and used him to capture Invisible Woman.
 Mister Fantastic freed the Thing from his control and defeated the Puppet Master.


In the three-part special episode, "Mask of Doom", Doctor Doom captures the Fantastic Four and forces Mister Fantastic, Human Torch, and the Thing to go back in time and obtain an object for him.


In the second season's premiere episode "And a Blind Man Shall Lead Them" (guest starring Daredevil), Doctor Doom strikes at a now fully powerless Fantastic Four and has his hand crushed by the Thing.
 Wizard also used a device to control the Thing.
 More to the point, Beau Weaver (Reed Richards/Mister Fantastic) and Chuck McCann (Ben Grimm/The Thing) reprise their roles from the Fantastic Four series.
 While the Yancy Street Gang never appear in the solo Fantastic Four cartoon itself, they appear in "Fantastic Fortitude", where they pull a prank on the Thing.
