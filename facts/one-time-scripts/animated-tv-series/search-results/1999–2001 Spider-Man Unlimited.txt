 It is soon discovered that Venom and Carnage are also on Counter-Earth, and are following orders from the Synoptic, a hive-minded legion of Counter-Earth symbiotes.

 Failing to stop them, Venom and Carnage took the ship Counter-Earth, with Jameson hostage.
 He crashed on Counter-Earth due to interference from Venom and Carnage, who had stowed aboard his ship.

 They appear too late when the plans of Venom and Carnage unfold and the symbiotes are unleashed, ending the series on a cliffhanger.
The series was somewhat referred to in the Webspinners: Tales of Spider-Man issues #13 and 14 from February and March 2000 where the Peter Parker of Earth-616 is teleported into another dimension ruled by Blastaar while chasing Carnage (who himself was running away from the NYC police) and finds himself in the costume Spider-Man wore in this TV Show.

Spider-Man Unlimited

Spider-Man

Spider-Man Unlimited is an animated television series produced by Saban Entertainment[2] which features the Marvel comic book superhero Spider-Man, intended as a loose sequel series to the previous Spider-Man: The Animated Series, which ran from 1994 to 1998.
The specific incarnation of Spider-Man who serves as the focus of Spider-Man Unlimited made a return in the 2023 feature film Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, depicted as a member of Miguel O'Hara's Spider-Society.
Initially, the goal was to do a low-budget adaptation of the first 26 issues of The Amazing Spider-Man comic book, but Sony and Marvel had already engaged in a deal to produce the Spider-Man movie, and so Saban was cut from any source and could not use the traditional Spider-Man suit or adapt the early comics.
 Also, in the original idea, Spider-Man was stranded in a Counter-Earth in which Ben Parker did not die and thus Peter Parker lacked the moral fortitude to resist becoming Venom.
[8] Additional, the show was made after Marvel decided not to move ahead with a show focusing on Spider-Man 2099 following consideration due to the DC Comics show set in the DC Animated Universe, Batman Beyond premiering earlier that year which covered the futuristic setting.
While covering the launch of John Jameson's one-man mission to Counter-Earth (another Earth located on the far side of the Sun), Spider-Man attempts to stop his two symbiote adversaries Venom and Carnage from boarding the shuttlecraft.
 Jonah Jameson of the Daily Bugle, Spider-Man becomes a target of persecution by the media and the public at large, with a bounty placed on his head.
 After John Jameson had made contact with Earth through a distress signal, Spider-Man borrows nanotechnology from Reed Richards to design a new suit that incorporates built in webshooters, stealth technology and anti-symbiote sonic weaponry.
 Making his way to Counter-Earth after persuading an attacking Nick Fury to let him rescue Jameson, Spider-Man learns that Jameson has fallen in with a band of freedom fighters opposed to the High Evolutionary whose Beastials, hybrids of animal and humanoid attributes, are the dominant species whilst humans are the second-class minority.
With Jameson reluctant to return until all of the Beastials are defeated, Spider-Man elects to remain on Counter-Earth, blending in as best as he can as Peter Parker, taking up residence in the apartment of a doctor, Naoko Yamada-Jones and her son Shane and fighting the High Evolutionary, his Knights of Wundagore, and his Machine Men alongside the rebels as Spider-Man.
Peter Parker / Spider-Man (voiced by Rino Romano) – a photographer for the Daily Bugle newspaper who was bitten by a radioactive spider and received spider-like abilities, becoming the superhero known as Spider-Man.
 The series begins with Spider-Man attempting to stop Venom and Carnage from escaping in a rocket piloted by John Jameson.
 She has a dislike for Spider-Man despite his heroics as she is unaware that Spider-Man is actually Peter Parker.
 He, like his mother, doesn't know of Peter's Spider-Man secret.
 He and Spider-Man joined the human rebels to fight the High Evolutionary and his Beastials and restore peace to Counter-Earth.
 He worked with John Jameson in the Human Rebels and met Spider-Man when he was sent to rescue him from the Knights of Wundagore that tried to reveal his true race.
 He was kidnapped by the High Evolutionary, but was saved by Spider-Man, Karen and John.
 Sir Ram later implanted a chip for a trap against the rebels but Spider-Man destroys it.
 The High Evolutionary's plan was simple, to turn this planet into an earthly paradise, no matter what it takes, that is until Spider-Man and the Symbiotes led by Venom and Carnage arrived.
 The High Evolutionary was injured during the series finale in a fight against Spider-Man, Green Goblin, and The Rebellion, led by Karen and John Jameson.
 When Spider-Man came to Counter-Earth, she was immediately attracted to him.
 She usually was trying to seduce Spider-Man.
 When Lady Vermin caught Spider-Man inside Wundagore Castle, he tricked her into thinking he wanted to see her, much to her happiness.
 Later, Spider-Man states that she was "Getting Ready" when he knocked her out.
 The Hunter is hired by the High Evolutionary to hunt and kill and/or capture Spider-Man.
 Upon breaking into his lair, Spider-Man discovered that the Hunter was using a toxic formula that when mixed with certain animal pheromones gives traits of that animal to the drinker, but also poisons bone marrow, damages the liver, and cuts the lifespan in half.
 Spider-Man defeats him by trouncing him and turning his security system against him stating that he now knows the Hunter's secret.
 Spider-Man warns the Hunter that if he comes after the Rebels or him again, he will use this knowledge to beat him into the ground.
 During the fight, Spider-Man continues to make references about the original Electro.
 1 where he blames Spider-Man for what happened with his son's shuttle.
Mary Jane Watson-Parker (voiced by Jennifer Hale) – at some point, Mary Jane Watson married Peter, and Peter revealed his secret identity as Spider-Man to her.
 They continued to be a happily married couple and Mary Jane was constantly worried about Peter's life as Spider-Man.
 When Spider-Man attempted to steal a shuttle to hitch a ride to Counter-Earth, Fury attempted to stop him before he realized that Spider-Man was right, and allowed him to carry on with his mission.
 This version is actually a hero instead of a villain, mistaking Spider-Man for a villain during their first encounter.
 The Goblin next appears when he finds out that both Spider-Man and Peter Parker are the same person.
 He also learns that Spider-Man is from the original Earth and his intentions on Counter-Earth are to rescue John Jameson.
 Since Jameson, who is working with the rebels against the High Evolutionary, does not agree to come and lets Spider-Man go off on his own, the Goblin decides to help by getting a ship the High Evolutionary has, which was originally Spider-Man's called Solaris II.
 Like the Counter Earth Green Goblin, this version of the Vulture is a hero instead of a villain and also like the Counter-Earth Goblin where he first mistook Spider-Man for a villain.
The following list reflects the correct viewing order of the Spider-Man Unlimited episodes.
When Spider-Man spots his two main enemies Venom and Carnage, hijacking on John Jameson's spaceship on a trip to the mysterious planet Counter-Earth, he fails to stop them and the two symbiote villains go with Jameson to Counter-Earth where the ship crashes and Jameson presumably dies.
 Jonah Jameson and public then blames Spider-Man for Jameson's seeming death.
 Spider-Man fakes his own death and lies low for half a year until he gets a new nano-tech costume from Reed Richards and gets another ride to Counter-Earth following a distress signal making it to Earth.
After escaping from the Knights of Wundagore before he can be experimented on, Spider-Man finds out that John Jameson survived the crash.
 Spider-Man then joins the group and moves in with a single mother named Dr.
Spider-Man meets the Counter-Earth version of the Green Goblin, a hero who mistakes Spider-Man for a villain.
 Spider-Man realizes the kidnapper of Dr.
 The rebellion and the Beastials are forced to team up to get it back before both humans and Beastials are killed by the contagious compound within the bomb as Spider-Man learns Git's history that involved Sir Ram.
 So he betrays the High Evolutionary and the Knights and decides to join the rebellion after he was previously saved by Spider-Man.
When the High Evolutionary sees that Spider-Man is a bug in his plans, he has his minion, Sir Ram, hire an assassin named the Hunter (Counter-Earth's version of Kraven the Hunter) to kill the hero.
Spider-Man teams up with the Counter-Earth hero version of the Vulture to foil one of Sir Ram's evil plots to transform humans into Bestials and defeat his creation Firedrake.
John Jameson turns into Man-Wolf and Spider-Man has to break into the High Evolutionary's power plant to find a cure for him.
The Goblin returns and figures out that Spider-Man is Peter Parker.
 They attempt to sneak into one of the High Evolutionary's hideouts in Atlantic City so Spider-Man can escape where he pretends to help the Rejects.
Spider-Man agrees to help Bromley, a member of the rebellion against the High Evolutionary, to find his long-lost brother Gabriel.
 Spider-Man agrees to retrieve it by donning it and then give it back to Brock before he dies while contending with Carnage.
Karen O'Malley, a member of the rebellion against the High Evolutionary, is kidnapped by Machine Men of the Evolutionary, so Spider-Man and X-51 teams up to save her.
 Spider-Man, John Jameson, the rebellion, X-51 and the Goblin all team up to put an end to the High Evolutionary's plans.
