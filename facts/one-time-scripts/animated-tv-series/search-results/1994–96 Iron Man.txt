Armor
-------------
 The show was backed by a toy line that featured many armor variants.
 In his evil endeavors to steal Stark's technology and Iron Man's armor, the Mandarin led a group of villains consisting of Dreadknight, Blizzard, Blacklash, Grey Gargoyle (when it comes to fighting Iron Man and his team, he has a tendency to accidentally turn his fellow villains to stone), Hypnotia (an exclusive villain whom Dreadknight and Blacklash were rivals for the affections of), Whirlwind, Living Laser, MODOK, Fin Fang Foom, and Justin Hammer.
" episodes[5]), but these were rare occasions, with virtually every other plot simply consisting of the Mandarin attempting to steal Stark's newest invention and being bested, often through very strange and illogical means (with the nadir perhaps being Iron Man somehow using the energy of a small tape-player to restore his armor to full power in "Silence My Companion, Death My Destination").


One major change was that, like in the comics, Tony Stark's worsening medical condition (brought upon by a missile striking him in the season premiere causing severe damage to his already ill body) required him to need periodic recharges of his "body battery" (represented as a piece of cybernetic tech over his right pectoral muscle) to keep him alive, akin to how in the comics Tony needed his armor's chest plate to keep him alive (though unlike in the comics he did not need to wear the chest plate at all times).
 Another major change was that Tony could literally change armors on the fly, represented as vocalizing the name of the specific armor, which would then appear in place of his usual suit in a ring of energy (and would similarly revert to his usual armor as necessary); in addition to the hydro, stealth and space armors, as seen in the comics, several new armors were invented for the second season (and in turn for the toy line), specifically magnetic (able to give off electro-magnetic charges), radiation (used for situations involving contaminated areas), inferno (fire-fighting), subterranean (for drilling underground) and samurai (never actually used in combat).


Also, War Machine develops a phobia of being trapped inside his armor (also based on a then-current comic storyline), but this is resolved before the final episode.
 While Rhodes was active as War Machine in season 1, he remained out of armor for the majority of season 2 due to reliving a tragic drowning experience while being trapped underwater in the War Machine armor in the season 2 episode "Fire and Rain".
 Rhodes eventually overcomes his fear and dons the War Machine armor once again in the episode "Distant Boundaries".

The Avengers: United They Stand
Iron Man, also known as Iron Man: The Animated Series, is an American animated television series based on Marvel Comics' superhero Iron Man.
 The series aired from 1994 to 1996 in syndication as part of The Marvel Action Hour, which packaged Iron Man with another animated series based on Marvel properties, the Fantastic Four, with one half-hour episode from each series airing back-to-back.
[1][2]

This series of Iron Man was among the few television series to be re-recorded in THX.
 Off the heels of the release of the live-action Iron Man film in 2008, reruns began airing on the Jetix block on Toon Disney.


Although only lasting two seasons, Iron Man was the subject of a major overhaul between seasons when its production studio was changed.
[1]

First season
The first season of Iron Man featured little more than a Masters of the Universe-style battle of "good against evil", as billionaire industrialist Tony Stark battled the evil forces of the world-conquering Mandarin as the armored superhero, Iron Man.
 In his evil endeavors to steal Stark's technology and Iron Man's armor, the Mandarin led a group of villains consisting of Dreadknight, Blizzard, Blacklash, Grey Gargoyle (when it comes to fighting Iron Man and his team, he has a tendency to accidentally turn his fellow villains to stone), Hypnotia (an exclusive villain whom Dreadknight and Blacklash were rivals for the affections of), Whirlwind, Living Laser, MODOK, Fin Fang Foom, and Justin Hammer.
 To combat these villains, Iron Man had the help of his own team (based on Force Works, a then-current comic book team which has since faded into obscurity), including Century, War Machine, Scarlet Witch, Hawkeye (replacing U.
 The closest the season came to adapting a comic book tale was in the two-part "The Origin of Iron Man", which recounted a (modified and modernized) version of the character's comic book origin (see below) just before the season concluded.
[3] The show is generally held to have been at its best when filling in these origin blanks (MODOK in "Enemy Without, Enemy Within,"[4] Iron Man and the Mandarin in their self-titled "The Origin of.
" episodes[5]), but these were rare occasions, with virtually every other plot simply consisting of the Mandarin attempting to steal Stark's newest invention and being bested, often through very strange and illogical means (with the nadir perhaps being Iron Man somehow using the energy of a small tape-player to restore his armor to full power in "Silence My Companion, Death My Destination").
 It culminates in "The Wedding of Iron Man" when Stark realizes they have been spied on by reviewing events from previous episodes (and explaining how Mandarin's forces always knew where they would be), realizing that Mandarin has acquired enough information to potentially deduce the true identity of Iron Man.
 The entire episode's plot is dedicated to resolving the problem, culminating in Iron Man and his team setting up an elaborate deception where Mandarin sees Iron Man and Tony Stark in the same place with the intention being to convince him that the two men are not the same person (the 'Tony' in this situation was an android).
 The first season's theme song was replaced in the second season by an intense electric guitar theme (composed by William Kevin Anderson), featuring the repeated refrain of "I am Iron Man!
", while showing Tony Stark beating red-hot iron plates into shape with a blacksmith's hammer (possibly to mimic the Black Sabbath song "Iron Man").
 In the first season, the series seemed to follow the look of an early 1990s Marvel comic (specifically, artist Paul Ryan's[9] take on Iron Man).
 "Empowered" was the clip show of the season, the purpose being that the Mandarin wanted to learn of Iron Man's recent activities.
 Iron Man reunites with Force Works in order to stop him.
 The Mandarin unmasks Iron Man before their final showdown ends in his death.
 More specifically, Iron Man manages to reflect the power of Mandarin's rings, destroying them, and ultimately leaving the Mandarin with amnesia and helpless before a band of mountain bandits who likely killed him.

Dorian Harewood reprises his role of War Machine from the solo Iron Man animated series in The Incredible Hulk episode "Helping Hand, Iron Fist".
 He originally stops Rick Jones from seeing Tony Stark (voiced by Robert Hays, who was also reprising his Iron Man role) at Stark Enterprises, but takes him to Stark after Jones explained that he needed Stark's help to find Bruce Banner.
 War Machine fights some of the Hulkbusters alongside Jones and Iron Man.
 Iron Man was once again voiced by Robert Hays and a different version of War Machine was voiced by James Avery (reprising their parts from the Iron Man animated series around the same period at the time when Dorian Harewood was voicing Tombstone).
 After the Symbiotes steal the machine, War Machine is too wounded to continue fighting, so Iron Man teams up with Spider-Man and stops the Symbiotes and prevent Dormammu from leaving his dimension.
 Iron Man later appears in the three-part episode "Secret Wars" in which the Beyonder creates a war between good and evil to see who is better.
