Captain America begins to face Hulk, still on a rampage from Diablo's alchemic control, and starts by playing defense with his vibranium shield to gauge the situation.
 After forcing Hulk to tire himself out, Captain America goes from playing defense to outwitting Hulk to forcing him into a test of endurance, which Hulk loses.
 Captain America and Thor join Iron Man and Hulk on the ground, and thanks to some learned trickery Jessica brings Wasp back into the mix after getting her DISK back from Riley.

While Wasp, Captain America, and Thor keep Tim and a couple of his Tech villains busy, Akira and Ed attempt to get their hands on a new DISK from a dangerous location in a construction site.
 After the argument, Chris remarks to Ed that his hesitant attitude makes him the weak link in the team, and Captain America requests Chris to stop, mentioning "Bucky" off-hand.
 Back at the base, while everyone else is excited about getting take-out, Captain America watches Chris practice boxing in a mirror, as more memories of Bucky are stirred.
 Hikaru doesn't notice, and Chris is forced to pull him out of the way, worrying Captain America.
 After seeing that Chris is okay, Captain America starts yelling at him, saying that he is untrained and should leave the difficult stunts to an Avenger.
 Back at the base, Chris is begged by Captain America to stay, asking where he went wrong as a mentor.
 Chris cuts Captain America off, storms off, and is approached by Thor and Hikaru.
 Later, as the team is discussing how they'd fight without Captain America, Iron Man once again insists on recruiting Noriko, but Hikaru stops him entirely.
 Ōkuma approaches Hikaru with a tied-up Noriko and demands the DISKs of not only Cyclops, but also Captain America.
 At an airport security line, Chris finds the DISK for Captain America in his pocket, forcing him to stay in Japan.
 As Ōkuma is about to D-Secure Noriko herself, Chris arrives and D-Smashes Captain America to deal with Zemo.
 Iron Man and Thor express how not capturing Captain America at that moment was extremely foolish, but Loki ignores them and proceeds with his plan anyway.
 Despite his biocode not having fully recharged, Chris looks to his future with certainty and manages to D-Smash Captain America.
 Reuniting with his sons, Nozomu directs Captain America to aim at the bust of Loki that served as the entrance doorway to the chamber.

 The battle scene is then interrupted by Wolverine, who displays how he has found the DISK containing Cyclops.
 A safe distance away, Iron Man apologizes for what happened to Cyclops and offers Wolverine to join the DISK-securing effort.
 Pepper tries to explain that history wouldn't repeat itself, but Cyclops had already considered that in the past and had since become living proof that it was false.
 Since Thor's DISK is unavailable, Wolverine gives Hikaru Cyclops' DISK instead, since he is also an Energy-class hero.

Captain America begins to face Hulk, still on a rampage from Diablo's alchemic control, and starts by playing defense with his vibranium shield to gauge the situation.
 While Hulk is distracted, Akira and Hikaru recall Iron Man and Thor, who desperately needed time to recover.
 After forcing Hulk to tire himself out, Captain America goes from playing defense to outwitting Hulk to forcing him into a test of endurance, which Hulk loses.
 Akira secures Hulk in a new DISK, freeing him from his control.
 Seeing as how Whirlwind's tornado shielding makes it impossible for the Stark Industries Jet to make it through to the frigate, Akira tries D-Smashing Hulk, the only one who could make it through, but to no avail.
 This explains how Akira, locked to Tech-class DISKS, failed to D-Smash Hulk and then as an example Thor.
 While King Cobra captures Jessica and Riley takes the DISK containing Wasp, Iron Man asks to be released and sent to face the tornado with Hulk's DISK and a wristband in hand.
 After barely making it through alive with as much moral support as possible from Akira (despite the dissuasions from the rest of his team) Ed catches Hulk's DISK and attracts attention while heading the wristband.
 Hulk, upon being released by Ed, faces against what's left against Diablo's alchemic control, knocking the villain into Whirlwind and knocking out the tornado.
 Captain America and Thor join Iron Man and Hulk on the ground, and thanks to some learned trickery Jessica brings Wasp back into the mix after getting her DISK back from Riley.
 Jessica and Ed manage to capture a defeated Whirlwind, Diablo, and King Cobra while Captain America, Hulk, and Wasp try to find Spider-Man before it's too late.
 Juggernaut nearly finishes off Iron Man, believing himself invincible, but Ed eventually stops hesitating and sends out Hulk to face Juggernaut.
 Hulk delivers a massive reverberating blow to Juggernaut's helmet, causing him to keel over in pain.

 Ed D-Smashes Hulk by mistake, shaking the structure and accidentally knocking the DISK down.
 Back at the base, Hawkeye stops by the still-sulking Ed outside and uses reverse psychology to anger Hulk into giving Ed a moral boost.

 Tom traps Iron Man in a DISK, which is then taken by Spider-Man, who instructs Akira to send Iron Man out to finish the job.
 There, Nick Fury and a tiny hologram Iron Man (from inside the red DISK) reveal that because the biocode installer was damaged when it installed a biocode in the kids, the kids have a Limited Biocode, which only allows the released heroes to be outside the DISK for a few minutes and also requires hours to recharge.

 While Jessica and Ed use their wits to find a way out of their cell, Iron Man and Thor are defeated by Hulk, who sees them as monsters of their own.
 While Hulk is distracted, Akira and Hikaru recall Iron Man and Thor, who desperately needed time to recover.
 In the present, Iron Man explains how every hero and villain is split into one of the five classes, and that every Biocode is permanently locked onto the first one D-Smashed.
 While King Cobra captures Jessica and Riley takes the DISK containing Wasp, Iron Man asks to be released and sent to face the tornado with Hulk's DISK and a wristband in hand.
 Captain America and Thor join Iron Man and Hulk on the ground, and thanks to some learned trickery Jessica brings Wasp back into the mix after getting her DISK back from Riley.
 The next day, Akira and Iron Man find themselves in a dojo belonging to an old friend and bitter enemy of Stark's, the Silver Samurai.

 Silver Samurai's duel proceeds as planned, despite Iron Man's objections, and Akira wins.
 Iron Man, attempting to build a new invention, directs Akira on what to do step-by-step, but ends up driving both him and Pepper crazy in the process.
 Eventually, Iron Man decides to compensate for this by building Akira a pair of jet-powered roller skates called Booster Skates.
 While testing them out outdoors, Akira and Iron Man find out the hard way that the Booster Skates have a bug in them that won't allow them to brake.
 Akira's biocode finishes recharging at the nick of time, and Iron Man catches them.
 With everyone heading back home and later to bed, Iron Man and Pepper finish the big invention from earlier in the day: the D-System, which can locate DISKs when they pop back into the world's dimension.

 In order to get to it, Thor has to use his lightning to power the computer and Iron Man has to hack the password using his armor.
 As Tim arrives at the plant, he runs into Iron Man and Thor, whereas the other three Avengers head out to take on Loki.
 Tim sends out Whiplash, who is defeated by Iron Man and Thor and D-Secured by Akira.
 They are intercepted along the way by Tim and Doctor Octopus, who manages to disable Iron Man and prevent any other hero from being D-Smashed using his tentacles.
 She then returns to the battle scene, D-Smashing Wasp to outmaneuver Doctor Octopus' tentacles and free Iron Man.

 Everything seems to be going well until Loki arrives disguised as Hikaru, tricking Thor into taking a Cane Blast point blank.
 Interrupting a brother-based conversation between Hikaru and Thor, Akira and his Booster Skates go out of control, and even Thor can't catch him due to an auto-evade feature Stark put in.

While Wasp, Captain America, and Thor keep Tim and a couple of his Tech villains busy, Akira and Ed attempt to get their hands on a new DISK from a dangerous location in a construction site.
 Later, Thor tells Hikaru the story of Loki and how he came to be the villain he currently is, stating that it is his responsibility to halt his schemes, not unlike Hikaru's responsibility to take care of Akira.
 In order to get to it, Thor has to use his lightning to power the computer and Iron Man has to hack the password using his armor.
 Before that can happen, Loki reaches out to Thor and invites him to "settle the score" a short distance away.
 Thor agrees, but Hikaru sees Loki's invitation as a plan to separate Thor from where he is needed and ensure victory.
 As Tim arrives at the plant, he runs into Iron Man and Thor, whereas the other three Avengers head out to take on Loki.
 Tim sends out Whiplash, who is defeated by Iron Man and Thor and D-Secured by Akira.

 Iron Man and Thor express how not capturing Captain America at that moment was extremely foolish, but Loki ignores them and proceeds with his plan anyway.
 After Iron Man and the Akatsukis give each other their thanks, Thor attempts to have Loki be ashamed of stealing the powers of others.
 However, Loki fakes Thor out and blasts him point blank.
 This drives Thor to overcome his constant responsibility to stop his brother's scheming while at the same time caring for him, and instead do it by any means necessary.
 He then proceeds to attack the Avengers with Diamondback's explosive diamonds, and repel Thor's hammer with Juggernaut's armor.

 Realizing what he intends to do, Thor warns Hikaru that the Sphere will corrupt him, but Hikaru shuts down his hologram and puts a shard of the mini-Sphere in his heart.


Back on the Helicarrier, the rest of the kids are happily waiting for Hikaru and Thor's return.

 Tony plans to pretend to fight Thor until they can come up with a more effective counterattack, but Thor will not play along.
 The fighting becomes more intense as Thor states he cannot let Hikaru kill anyone.
 Realizing that Thor will continue to protect Hikaru at all costs, the other Avengers vow to protect their young partners as well.
 He takes Hikaru to the tank bay where the Avengers are fighting and uses him as leverage to order Thor to kill the other Avengers, while the kids beg their teammates and friends to stop the madness.
 Thor steps in the way of the blast and orders the Avengers let him handle Hikaru since he and Hikaru are partners, this battle is theirs to fight.
