The Incredible Hulk
Hulk and the Agents of S.

The Incredible Hulk is an American animated television series starring the Marvel Comics character the Hulk.
 Lou Ferrigno, who portrayed the Hulk on the live-action TV series from 1978 to 1982, provided the Hulk's voice.
 In the second season, the show's format, after UPN decided that season one was too dark, was changed, and to give "female viewers a chance",[3] the network ordered that She-Hulk be made a regular co-star, as a result; the series was officially renamed The Incredible Hulk and She-Hulk for the second season.
 The second season also featured Grey Hulk, who previously made two cameo appearances in the first season.
 Robert Bruce Banner already established as the Hulk and on the run,[4] when he is captured by the military after another attempt at ridding himself of the beast within goes awry due to the sabotage of Major Glenn Talbot.
 La Roquette (later Redeemer and Rock, respectively) were also mentioned as members) to capture or destroy the Hulk.
 He also fights the Hulk personally, using a gamma-powered laser gun created by Bruce against the creature in "Return of the Beast, parts 1 and 2", and again in "Darkness and Light part 3".
 He is also shown to have a romantic interest in Betty Ross, but she constantly rejects him because he never does a very good job of hiding his disdain for either Bruce Banner or the Hulk.
 Not even his family is safe from the terror his hidden powers bring, as his best friend and cousin Jennifer Walters is critically injured by Doctor Doom, forcing Banner to give her a blood transfusion that transforms her into the She-Hulk.
 Jennifer takes immediate delight in her transformed body and chooses to remain in her She-Hulk form full-time.
 Walter Langkowski (Sasquatch) to get a cure for himself and get rid of Hulk forever, only to find that Walter has developed a bestial alter ego while using himself as a test subject to make a breakthrough in gamma radiation.
 After battling the Hulk, Walter/Sasquatch exiles himself to the wilderness when his actions put Hulk's new friend, a small boy named Taylor, in danger.


Simon Templeman reprised his role of Doctor Doom (who as previously mentioned, critically injured Jennifer Walters/She-Hulk) for guest appearances in two episodes, in which Doom held Washington, D.
 captive, only to be defeated by She-Hulk, whom he later attempted to claim revenge upon.
 The episode seems to place this show in the same continuity as the Fantastic Four cartoon of the same decade as this episode plays off the Hulk's appearance in the other show.
 In the episode, Mister Fantastic and the other Fantastic Four take their vacation before Hulk, She-Hulk, and Thing fight Leader's Gamma Soldiers commanded by Leader's minion Ogress.
 Meanwhile, She-Hulk flirted with Thing, but Ben chose to rekindle his relationship with Alicia Masters.
 Donald as Thor brought Hulk to Detroit so that Bruce Banner can help cure a gamma-based outbreak unintentionally caused by Gargoyle (in his search to cure his disfigurement).


Throughout the season running sub-plots gradually unfold, centering mostly on several of the supporting cast, the season slowly covers the following:

Betty attempts to construct a Gamma Nutrient Bath that will separate Banner from the Hulk with the aid of Doc Samson.

The Leader succeeds in bringing to life obedient mutant Gamma Warriors upon creating them from Hulk's DNA where they also sport cybernetic parts.
 Also in that episode, he starts hitting on She-Hulk.

These plot threads converge in the three-part season finale "Darkness and Light", where Betty's gamble pays off and the Hulk and Banner are separated.
 The Hulk emerges virtually mindless and unrestrained.
 The Leader finally gains the power of the Hulk, but the savage Hulk personality takes over, driving him mad, and forcing him to abandon the power and restore it to the creature.
 Though hospitalized and in critical condition, Ross interrupts Banner's wedding ceremony and threatens to kill Banner, who suffers a heart attack, as the separation from the Hulk finally begins taking its toll.
 This leads Banner's friends into concluding that he and the Hulk must be merged again, or both will die.
 He is interrupted by Rick, whom he hurls into the vat containing Banner and the Hulk.
 The experiment malfunctions and the vat erupts; from it emerges a gamma-powered, hulk-like Jones, who escapes into the night, as the distraught but healthy Banner suddenly transforms into the Grey Hulk.


Season 2
The Incredible Hulk and She-Hulk begins where the first season concluded, with the Grey Hulk in the mountains, solely pursued by the still insane Ross.
 Banner's cousin Jennifer, the She-Hulk, tries to help him out in court.

Gargoyle displays a strong affection for She-Hulk.
 He still tries to cure himself of becoming the Hulk.

Whenever Banner transforms, Grey Hulk and Green Hulk fight for control in Banner's mind and the one who wins, breaks out.

The remainder of the season saw Banner and Jennifer either team up with characters such as Doctor Strange, battle Doctor Doom once more, or participate in a fight during Jennifer's high school reunion party (where She-Hulk temporarily changed back to Jennifer).
 The episode "Mind Over Anti-Matter" features Doctor Strange and She-Hulk journeying into the mind of Bruce Banner when Banner is possessed by an evil demon alien.
 Banner in the process turns into a monstrous Dark Hulk.
 She-Hulk provides levity at the sorcerer's expense by referring to him as Doctor Peculiar and other variations of his name.

 In the second season, the show's format, after UPN decided that season one was too dark, was changed, and to give "female viewers a chance",[3] the network ordered that She-Hulk be made a regular co-star, as a result; the series was officially renamed The Incredible Hulk and She-Hulk for the second season.
 Not even his family is safe from the terror his hidden powers bring, as his best friend and cousin Jennifer Walters is critically injured by Doctor Doom, forcing Banner to give her a blood transfusion that transforms her into the She-Hulk.
 Jennifer takes immediate delight in her transformed body and chooses to remain in her She-Hulk form full-time.


Simon Templeman reprised his role of Doctor Doom (who as previously mentioned, critically injured Jennifer Walters/She-Hulk) for guest appearances in two episodes, in which Doom held Washington, D.
 captive, only to be defeated by She-Hulk, whom he later attempted to claim revenge upon.
 In the episode, Mister Fantastic and the other Fantastic Four take their vacation before Hulk, She-Hulk, and Thing fight Leader's Gamma Soldiers commanded by Leader's minion Ogress.
 Meanwhile, She-Hulk flirted with Thing, but Ben chose to rekindle his relationship with Alicia Masters.
 Also in that episode, he starts hitting on She-Hulk.


Season 2
The Incredible Hulk and She-Hulk begins where the first season concluded, with the Grey Hulk in the mountains, solely pursued by the still insane Ross.
 Banner's cousin Jennifer, the She-Hulk, tries to help him out in court.

Gargoyle displays a strong affection for She-Hulk.

The remainder of the season saw Banner and Jennifer either team up with characters such as Doctor Strange, battle Doctor Doom once more, or participate in a fight during Jennifer's high school reunion party (where She-Hulk temporarily changed back to Jennifer).
 The episode "Mind Over Anti-Matter" features Doctor Strange and She-Hulk journeying into the mind of Bruce Banner when Banner is possessed by an evil demon alien.
 She-Hulk provides levity at the sorcerer's expense by referring to him as Doctor Peculiar and other variations of his name.
