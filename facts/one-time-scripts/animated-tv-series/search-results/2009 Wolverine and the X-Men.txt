-------------
Carnage
-------------
 In the aftermath of the carnage, Magneto is banished from Genosha for his radical actions while his eldest daughter, Wanda, assumes authority over the destroyed island and its inhabitants, alongside her sister Lorna, in an attempt to rebuild from the demolished remains of her father's mistakes.

-------------
Cerebro
-------------
 Unfortunately, without the necessary capabilities of a competent telepath to operate Cerebro, the possibility of locating some of the more globally scattered X-Men members along with the missing Charles Xavier and Jean seems all but a pipe dream.
 Forge has been brought to the team to repair Cerebro and the Blackbird.
 Wolverine is suspicious in the beginning but reluctantly agrees, believing that Emma only has intentions to take control of Cerebro.

23	"Shades of Grey"	Doug Murphy	Greg Johnson & Craig Kyle (story)
Greg Johnson (writer)	November 20, 2009	123
An amnesic Jean uses her incredibly strong and powerful telepathic and telekinetic abilities while at the hospital, which allows Emma to locate her using Cerebro.
 In the future, the Professor is apprehended by Sentinels, who have replicated Cerebro to find all mutants in the world.

 Upon the team's – and particularly Wolverine's – reluctant acceptance of the offer, Emma's efforts prove successful as she is able to locate a comatose Charles on the shores of Genosha in the care of Magneto.
 After their arrival on Genosha and a short confrontation with the Master of Magnetism himself, Magneto eventually permits the X-Men to take his old friend's body back to the sanctity of the Mansion where he is certain that Xavier will be placed in proper care.


Meanwhile, Magneto welcomes new mutants to Genosha, one of whom is Nightcrawler.
 Magneto claims that Genosha is a safe and secure area for mutants, rather than a threat.
 At first Nightcrawler believes this, but upon closer inspection, Genosha is exposed as a method to use mutants' powers by Magneto.

Gambit arrives on Genosha under the orders of Senator Kelly to steal Magneto's helmet as a provocation of war, as well as cripple Genosha's resources.
 Wolverine and Nightcrawler head to Genosha to prevent Gambit from stealing Magneto's helmet.
 Though Gambit seems attracted to Polaris, he leaves her at the end with Magneto's helmet.
 Through the intervention of the X-Men, Magneto, and Senator Kelly reach an understanding about their impending war and the dystopian future.
 Meanwhile, Magneto hatches a plot against the human race, having replaced Senator Kelly with Mystique to start an attack on Genosha.
 In Genosha, Magneto's plan comes to fruition as Sentinels ravage the island, providing just cause for Magneto's war against humanity.
 Accordingly, Magneto reprograms the Sentinels to attack humans.


Trivia: Magneto's reprogramming of the Sentinels is very reminiscent of a similar event in Ultimate X-Men, whereby a massive fleet of the Sentinels were sent to Genosha, but Magneto reprogrammed them, and sent them to attack Washington, D.
 fight against Magneto's Sentinels.
 In the aftermath of the carnage, Magneto is banished from Genosha for his radical actions while his eldest daughter, Wanda, assumes authority over the destroyed island and its inhabitants, alongside her sister Lorna, in an attempt to rebuild from the demolished remains of her father's mistakes.

Nightcrawler
-------------
 While some were met with initial hesitancy such as with Nightcrawler, others such as Storm were more than willing to accept the offer once Xavier's vision had been put into perspective.


Meanwhile, Magneto welcomes new mutants to Genosha, one of whom is Nightcrawler.
 At first Nightcrawler believes this, but upon closer inspection, Genosha is exposed as a method to use mutants' powers by Magneto.
 Nightcrawler eventually escapes, but is captured by Mystique when he arrives back at the mansion.

Phoenix Force
-------------


It is later revealed in the three-part first-season finale "Foresight" that the previously assumed attack on the Mansion was not from the efforts of a third party, but rather from the result of Jean who unwittingly releases the immense and highly destructive strength and power of the Phoenix Force, that originally lay dormant deep within her subconscious, in an attempt to halt an oncoming telepathic attack led by Emma (who was secretly working as a double agent for the Inner Circle and the Stepford Cuckoos).
 Along with Sebastian Shaw, Selene, Harry Leland, and Donald Pierce, it was the Inner Circle's utmost duty to not only obtain the power of the Phoenix Force by abducting Jean from the protection of Xavier and the Mansion, but to also obliterate the ancient being's existence before it could fully mature and consequently bring forth unparalleled destruction onto the world as it had done numerous times in the past throughout Earth's history.
 However, in a move that was completely unknown to Emma at the time, the rest of the Inner Circle members all shared an entirely different and more sinister vision than Frost had initially believed: to control and manipulate the power of the Phoenix Force and have it cater to their own hidden agenda.


Introducing characters: The Phoenix Force (flashback)

This episode features the appearance of the original X-Men team consisting of a younger Cyclops, Jean Grey, Beast (without blue fur), Angel, and Iceman.
 Apparently, the Hellfire Club had become aware that the Phoenix Force had possessed Jean and supposedly wants to extract the divine Phoenix Force from her mind and use its infinite and limitless power and strength for their own ends.

Emma discovers the Hellfire Club's true motivation for using the Phoenix Force, and fights to free Jean alongside Cyclops.
 Meanwhile, the Inner Circle reveals to Scott that Emma and the Stepford Cuckoos were the ones responsible for setting in motion the events that would lead to the destruction of the mansion, Xavier's twenty-year coma and the eventual extraction of the Phoenix Force from Jean's mind and body.
 Upon the successful transmission of the Phoenix Force from Jean and into the bodies of all five Stepford Cuckoos, the possessed girls are then instructed by Sebastian Shaw to destroy the Sentinels, the X-Men and Genosha, an action which was completely unknown to Emma whose initial plan was to both locate and destroy the cosmic entity before it could reach maturity and bring forth unparalleled global destruction.
 In the wake of her regretable actions, Emma attempts to redeem herself in the eyes of the X-Men, especially Scott, by ultimately sacrificing herself in order to successfully destroy the Phoenix Force entity.

Vision

 While some were met with initial hesitancy such as with Nightcrawler, others such as Storm were more than willing to accept the offer once Xavier's vision had been put into perspective.
 However, in a move that was completely unknown to Emma at the time, the rest of the Inner Circle members all shared an entirely different and more sinister vision than Frost had initially believed: to control and manipulate the power of the Phoenix Force and have it cater to their own hidden agenda.

Wolverine and the X-Men is a 2009 American animated series by Marvel Entertainment.


Plot
The story begins with Wolverine and Rogue having an argument about him leaving.
 When Wolverine goes to Charles and Jean Grey, they get headaches.
 This course of action causes Wolverine and Beast to ally and resolve to bring the once defunct X-Men team back together again.
 Upon the team's – and particularly Wolverine's – reluctant acceptance of the offer, Emma's efforts prove successful as she is able to locate a comatose Charles on the shores of Genosha in the care of Magneto.
 Upon their return, Xavier telepathically contacts the X-Men twenty years from the present in an alternate dystopian future and informs Wolverine that he is to lead and reunite the X-Men if they wish to successfully prevent the inevitable war that will cause the world to fall under the domination of Master Mold and the Sentinels.


Elsewhere, Wolverine begins to have some visions from the past, and Emma offers to sort out his visions telepathically.
 In his visions, Wolverine meets a lone mutant girl, figure from the past Sabretooth, and finally discovers many mysteries about his past.
 Wolverine has Cyclops swear an oath to be in the X-Men again and promise not to go off searching for Jean.
 Rogue apologizes to Wolverine, and finally rejoins the X-Men for good.
