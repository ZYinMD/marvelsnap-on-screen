X-Men: The Animated Series
X-Men '97 is an American animated television series created by Beau DeMayo for the streaming service Disney+, based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the X-Men. It is a revival of X-Men: The Animated Series (1992–1997) produced by Marvel Studios, via its Marvel Animation label, and continues the story of the X-Men from the earlier series. DeMayo was head writer for the first two seasons and Matthew Chauncey took over for the third, with Jake Castorena as supervising director.

Ray Chase, Jennifer Hale, Alison Sealy-Smith, Cal Dodd, J. P. Karliak, Lenore Zann, George Buza, A. J. LoCascio, Holly Chou, Isaac Robinson-Smith, Matthew Waterson, Ross Marquand, and Adrian Hough star as members of the X-Men. Sealy-Smith, Dodd, Zann, Buza, and Hough reprised their roles from the original series, as did Christopher Britton. Original series stars Catherine Disher, Chris Potter, Alyson Court, Lawrence Bayne, and Ron Rubin returned to voice new characters.

The revival was first discussed in June 2019 and formally announced in November 2021, with DeMayo and Castorena attached. Chase Conley and Emi Yonemura also directed episodes. The series is the first X-Men project from Marvel Studios since the company regained the film and television rights to the characters. Animation was provided by Studio Mir and Tiger Animation, and is a modernized version of the original series' style. DeMayo was fired as head writer in March 2024 after completing work on the first two seasons. Chauncey was hired to write the third season in July 2024.

X-Men '97 premiered on March 20, 2024, with its first two episodes. The rest of the ten-episode first season was released weekly until May 15. It received critical acclaim and various accolades. A second season is in production and a third is in development.

Premise
X-Men '97 continues the story of X-Men: The Animated Series (1992–1997). In both series, mutants are people born with superhuman abilities that generally manifest during puberty. The X-Men are a team of mutant superheroes founded by Professor Charles Xavier to protect mutants and humans alike. At the end of The Animated Series, Xavier nearly dies in an assassination attempt and is taken to space to be healed by the alien Shi'ar Empire. X-Men '97 begins a year later and sees the X-Men facing new challenges without Xavier, under the leadership of their former adversary Magneto. As with the original series, X-Men '97 combines action, soap opera-style drama, and exploration of serious topics.[1][2]

Cast and characters
See also: List of X-Men: The Animated Series and X-Men '97 characters
Ray Chase as Scott Summers / Cyclops:
The mutant field leader of the X-Men whose eyes emit powerful beams of concussive energy.[3] Cyclops is prepared to lead the X-Men after the loss of Charles Xavier, before Magneto takes that role.[4] Chase replaces Cyclops's original voice actor Norm Spencer, who died in 2020.[5] Chase had not seen the original series when he auditioned, and was provided clips and references for the character's voice to base his performance on. After being cast, he watched the original series and listened to interviews of Spencer.[4]
Jennifer Hale as Jean Grey:
A powerful telepathic and telekinetic mutant who is married to Cyclops, and was once the host of the cosmic entity Phoenix Force.[3] Her relationship with Cyclops is complicated by Wolverine's feelings for her.[4] Hale, who previously voiced the character in other Marvel media, replaces original series voice actor Catherine Disher,[5][6] and based her performance on Disher's voice.[4] Hale also voices Madelyne Pryor / Goblin Queen, a mutant clone of Jean created by Mister Sinister. Madelyne gives birth to Cyclops's son, Nathan, which further complicates his relationship with Jean. Hale used a slightly different tone when voicing Madelyne to separate her from Jean.[4]
Alison Sealy-Smith as Ororo Munroe / Storm:
A powerful mutant who can control the weather and is described as a "goddess".[3] Sealy-Smith reprises her role from the original series,[5] and also voices the Adversary, a demon that feeds on negative emotions.[7]
Cal Dodd as Logan / Wolverine:
A hotheaded mutant with a regenerative healing factor, heightened senses, retractable claws, and an adamantium-laced skeleton.[3] Dodd reprises his role from the original series.[5]
J. P. Karliak as Morph:
A mutant metamorph who can change their voice and appearance to that of any person. Morph's base design is updated from the original series to be "pale, hairless, and blankly-featured" similar to the version of the character seen in the "Age of Apocalypse" comic book storyline and the Exiles comic book.[8] Morph identifies as non-binary,[8] but the series does not explicitly use that term as it was not common in the 1990s.[9][10] Characters that Morph shape-shifts into in the first season include Xavier, Jean Grey, Archangel,[11] Blob,[12] Lady Deathstryke, Colossus, Psylocke, Sabretooth,[11] Spiral,[13] Illyana Rasputina / Magik / Darkchylde, Quicksilver, Juggernaut, Hulk, Mister Sinister, Sauron, and Mister Fantastic.[11] Karliak replaces Morph's original voice actor Ron Rubin.[10] He also voices William Stryker, an anti-mutant Christian minister,[14] and the superhero Hulk.[15]
Lenore Zann as Rogue:
A mutant who absorbs the memories, powers, and energy of those she touches.[3] The series reveals that Rogue had a secret romantic relationship with Magneto when she was younger, causing friction in her current relationship with Gambit.[16] Zann reprises her role from the original series.[5]
George Buza as Dr. Henry "Hank" McCoy / Beast:
A blue-furred mutant genius with superhuman strength and agility.[3] Buza reprises his role from the original series.[5]
A. J. LoCascio as Remy LeBeau / Gambit:
A mutant and former thief who can charge objects with explosive kinetic energy, including his signature playing cards.[3] Gambit's actions in the early episodes—including wearing a crop top and taking his shirt off, and his relationship with Rogue—were intended to endear the audience to him before his death at the end of the fifth episode.[17] LoCascio replaces Gambit's original voice actor Chris Potter.[5]
Holly Chou as Jubilation Lee / Jubilee:
The youngest member of the X-Men who can create firework-like explosions.[3] Chou replaces Jubilee's original voice actor Alyson Court, who previously said she would not reprise the role and would prefer that an Asian-American actor take it.[18] Court instead voices Abscissa, an older version of Jubilee from the "Motendo" video game world.[19]
Isaac Robinson-Smith as Lucas Bishop:
A mutant from a dystopian future with the ability to absorb kinetic energy and redirect it into concussive blasts.[3] Robinson-Smith replaces Bishop's original voice actor Philip Akin.[5] Robinson-Smith also voices T'Chaka / Black Panther, the king of Wakanda. The character's appearance creates an apparent continuity error with the animated series Fantastic Four (1994–1996) in which he dies.[20]
Matthew Waterson as Erik "Magnus" Lehnsherr / Magneto:
A powerful mutant who controls magnetism. Magneto is given control of the X-Men in the last will and testament of Charles Xavier.[1][3] Waterson replaces Magneto's original voice actor David Hemblen, who died in 2020.[5]
Ross Marquand as Professor Charles Xavier:
The founder of the X-Men who was taken to space to be healed by the Shi'ar Empire following an assassination attempt.[21][22] Marquand replaces Xavier's original voice actor Cedric Smith. Coincidentally, both actors previously provided the voice for Marvel villain Red Skull in different projects.[22] Marquand also voices Doctor Doom, the leader of Latveria who is a member of "Operation: Zero Tolerance" (OZT);[23] and Apocalypse, one of the first mutants who is thousands of years old and an enemy of the X-Men, replacing John Colicos and James Blendick who voiced the character in the original series.[24]
Adrian Hough as Kurt Wagner / Nightcrawler:
A Catholic, blue mutant with teleporting abilities and prehensile hands and feet. Hough reprises his role from the original series in X-Men '97, which includes the character's playfulness from the comics.[25] Hough also voices Strong Guy, a mutant who can channel kinetic energy into physical strength.[26]

One year after Henry Peter Gyrich's assassination attempt on Professor Charles Xavier led to Xavier leaving Earth with the alien Shi'ar and being presumed dead,[a] the X-Men continue his mission of defending mutants and humans alike. Xavier's supposed death has led to the X-Men being legally sanctioned by the United Nations (UN). They save a young mutant, Roberto da Costa, from the anti-mutant group Friends of Humanity (FoH) who are using Sentinel technology. To find Sentinel creator Bolivar Trask, the X-Men visit Gyrich in prison and Jean Grey probes his mind using the machine Cerebro to amplify her psychic abilities. She locates Trask at a junkyard in the Sahara, but also receives a horrifying premonition. The X-Men destroy the remains of several Sentinels and a Master Mold supercomputer at the junkyard and apprehend Trask.

During his trial at the UN's headquarters, the FoH stage an attack. Their leader, X-Cutioner, shoots at Magneto with a depowering radiation blast; Storm takes the hit for him and loses her abilities. Jean goes into labor and Rogue is forced to absorb an obstetrician's knowledge when he refuses to deliver a mutant's baby. Jean gives birth to a son whom she and Cyclops name Nathan. After Magneto apprehends X-Cutioner and stops the assault, he is pardoned and discussions begin for the mutant nation Genosha to join the UN.

3	"Fire Made Flesh"	Emi Yonemura	Beau DeMayo and Charley Feldman	March 27, 2024
Beast determines that the Jean look-alike is actually the real Jean Grey. The villainous Mister Sinister contacts the other Jean, revealing her to be a clone he created to gain access to her and Cyclops's DNA.

Morph, who was previously corrupted and controlled by Sinister, leads the X-Men to one of Sinister's labs where they find him infecting Nathan with a techno-organic virus under the belief that it will make the child invincible. The real Jean confronts the Goblin Queen telepathically and uses their shared memories to free her from Sinister's control. The clone Jean and Cyclops save Nathan, who is left gravely ill, while Sinister escapes.

The pair are pulled into a video game based on her previous adventures, created by the alien slave-master Mojo who feeds off audience engagement. Jubilee enjoys reliving her past missions, but is convinced by Abscissa—an older digital copy of herself from the game's beta version—that she would be living an empty life. Abscissa helps Jubilee and Roberto defeat Mojo, and the pair return to the real world. Jubilee kisses Roberto.

Forge takes Storm to his ranch where he has created a machine that can restore her powers, though it seemingly fails. Storm notices a strange owl flying around the ranch. When Forge admits that he designed the technology which mutant inhibitor collars and X-Cutioner's radiation gun were based on, Storm leaves in anger. The owl reveals itself to be a demon called the Adversary. It brings Storm back to the ranch and poisons Forge.
5	"Remember It"	Emi Yonemura	Beau DeMayo	April 10, 2024

Magneto, Rogue, and Gambit travel to Genosha, where the Genoshan council asks Magneto to lead the country; he agrees on the condition that Rogue leads with him. Rogue explains to Gambit that she had a secret relationship with Magneto when she was younger, as his abilities allow her to touch him without hurting him which she cannot do with Gambit. At a gala celebrating Genosha joining the UN, Rogue kisses Magneto and realizes that she made a mistake choosing him over Gambit. The time-traveling Cable arrives and Madelyne realizes that he is an adult Nathan. Cable is sent back to the future before he can warn everyone of what is coming: an upgraded Master Mold and army of Sentinels attack Genosha and kill thousands of mutants.

6	"Lifedeath – Part 2"	Chase Conley	Charley Feldman	April 17, 2024
During a war between the Shi'ar and Kree empires, Shi'ar empress Lilandra Neramani announces her engagement to a now-healed Xavier. Refusing to accept her sister marrying a Terran, Deathbird invokes the Rite of M'Dashaa and challenges Xavier to purge all of his memories of Earth to prove his loyalty to the Shi'ar. Xavier's refusal to renounce his memories of the X-Men results in a battle between the Shi'ar Imperial Guard and Deathbird's supporters until Xavier pulls everyone into the astral plane to educate them on co-existence. When this lesson is interrupted by a psychic vision of Gambit's death, Xavier decides to return to Earth. At the ranch, Forge uses his mother's spell book to expel the demon and then Storm helps him search for a rare cactus that can cure the poison. Storm finds the cactus in a cave, but is cornered by the Adversary once again. Overcoming her fears, Storm regains her powers and defeats the Adversary. Storm heals Forge, and then they learn about the attack on Genosha. Elsewhere, Trask is confronted by Mister Sinister who warns that Genosha was just the beginning.
7	"Bright Eyes"	Emi-Emmett Yonemura	Charley Feldman and JB Ballard	April 24, 2024

Roberto and Jubilee visit Roberto's mother and tell her that he is a mutant; she asks him to keep his identity a secret. In Madripoor, the X-Men learn that Sinister and the UN's secret "OZT" division have been developing a highly advanced Sentinel program. Rogue drops Trask to his death, unknowingly activating programming that turns him into a human–Sentinel hybrid. Cable arrives, defeats Trask with an EMP, and explains that Sinister is working with a greater threat that they must stop. This threat, who murdered Gyrich, is Bastion. He reveals to Sinister that Xavier is alive in space and that Magneto, presumed dead in the Genosha attack, is also alive and is Bastion's prisoner.
8	"Tolerance Is Extinction"	Chase Conley	Beau DeMayo and Anthony Sellitti	May 1, 2024
9	Emi-Emmett Yonemura	Anthony Sellitti	May 8, 2024
10	Chase Conley	Beau DeMayo and Anthony Sellitti	May 15, 2024
Part 1 : The UN reveals to the world that Xavier is alive, inciting an anti-mutant protest outside the school. Cable explains to the X-Men that the Genosha massacre is an "absolute point" in time that cannot be changed, and Bastion will use it to start a 300-year war that will lead to the enslavement of mutants in a human utopia. Cyclops, Jean, and Cable travel to Harmony, Pennsylvania, where they learn that Bastion is a human–machine hybrid who was conceived after his father was infected with part of the advanced, time-traveling Sentinel Nimrod.[b] Members of "Operation: Zero Tolerance" (OZT) express concern over the massacre and ask Dr. Cooper to monitor Bastion, who explains to her how he is turning humans into Prime Sentinels like Trask using Sinister's techno-organic virus. Prime Sentinels activate around the world, attack mutants, and burn down Xavier's school. A horrified Cooper releases Magneto, who creates a world-wide blackout that kills thousands of people and shuts down all of the Prime Sentinels. Wolverine fears that Magneto has declared war as Xavier returns and summons the X-Men.
Part 2 : Xavier is met with some distrust, but the X-Men focus on stopping Bastion and convincing Magneto to reverse his blackout. Magneto re-establishes his mutant haven on Asteroid M, choosing to leave Earth without power and reject Xavier's dream of mutant/human co-existence. He invites the X-Men to join him, which Rogue and Roberto do. The rest of the X-Men return to their former base on Muir Island to regroup, before splitting into two teams: Cyclops's Blue Team goes to Asteroid M to confront Magneto while Storm and Jean's Gold Team heads to Bastion's hideout in the Galápagos Islands. Beast and Forge create a collar that can block Bastion's technopathy and sever his control over the Sentinels. The Gold Team battles an army of Bastion-controlled Sentinels as well as Sinister, who takes control of Cable's mind and uses him to overpower Jean; she sends a desperate psychic message to Cyclops. On Asteroid M, Xavier attempts to take control of Magneto's mind but is blocked. Wolverine stabs and seriously injures Magneto who begins ripping the adamantium metal from Wolverine's skeleton.
Part 3 : With Wolverine critically injured, Xavier takes control of Magneto and restores power to Earth, fracturing Magneto's mind. Jean—connecting to the cosmic power of the Phoenix—places the collar on Bastion, restoring the Prime Sentinels' humanity, and reverses Sinister's mutant augmentations which frees Cable. The X-Men fight to prevent Bastion from crashing Asteroid M into Earth and causing a new extinction event, but it still plummets after the U.S. government launches missiles at the asteroid hoping to destroy it. With Xavier's help, Magneto regains consciousness and sends the asteroid into space. It explodes and most of the X-Men are presumed dead. Six months later, Bishop arrives and tells Forge that the X-Men are trapped in time: Cyclops and Jean are in 3960 A.D., a desolate future where they encounter Mother Askani and a young Nathan; and Rogue, Nightcrawler, Beast, Xavier, and Magneto are in Ancient Egypt in 3000 B.C. where they meet En Sabah Nur, a young version of Apocalypse. In a mid-credits scene, Apocalypse finds one of Gambit's playing cards in present-day Genosha.
Production
Development


X-Men: The Animated Series producers Larry Houston, Julia Lewald, and Eric Lewald returned to consult on X-Men '97
Larry Houston, the producer and director of X-Men: The Animated Series (1992–1997), said in June 2019 that he and that series' creative team were discussing a potential revival with Disney. They wanted to continue the story from where the original series ended.[54] Disney subsidiary Marvel Studios was developing their first animated series, What If...?, and executives began discussing what their next animated project could be. The first idea considered was a revival of X-Men: The Animated Series, which was suggested by Brad Winderbaum. The head of streaming, television, and animation at Marvel Studios, Winderbaum was a fan of the series,[55]: 15:50–16:02 [12] and said several filmmakers who had met with Marvel Studios in the past had cited that series as a touchstone.[56] In November 2020, Beau DeMayo was asked to present a pitch for the revival after working as a writer for Marvel Studios' live-action Disney+ miniseries Moon Knight (2022).[57][17]

By June 2021, Marvel Studios Animation was developing a slate of at least three series in addition to What If...? that,[58][59][60] as of August 2021, were in various stages of development and not expected to be released until 2023.[61] In November, one of these was announced to be X-Men '97, a revival and continuation of X-Men: The Animated Series.[62][63] Dana Vasquez-Eberhardt, VP of animation at Marvel Studios, said many of the people involved with the revival were fans of the 1990s series and "knew exactly" what the continuation should be.[56] DeMayo was announced as head writer and executive producer,[18][56] with Jake Castorena as supervising director and Charley Feldman as supervising producer.[56] Houston and the original series' showrunners, Eric and Julia Lewald, were consulting on the revival,[56][64] assisting with any "red flags" that arose and suggesting things they would like to see.[65] The trio were contacted by Winderbaum shortly after the revival series entered development, and were excited that Marvel chose to make a direct continuation of their series.[12] The Lewalds attributed Disney and Marvel Studios' fast-tracking of the revival to the success of the original series streaming on Disney+ and the book X-Men: The Art and Making of The Animated Series (2020).[66]: 55:47–56:48  Castorena, Chase Conley, and Emi Yonemura directed episodes of the first season. Marvel Studios' Winderbaum, Kevin Feige, Louis D'Esposito, and Victoria Alonso also served as executive producers.[67]

The series is the first X-Men project from Marvel Studios since they regained the film and television rights to the characters from 20th Century Fox,[68] which put more pressure on DeMayo to get the project right in addition to wanting to respect the original series.[69] X-Men '97 is not set in the Sacred Timeline of Marvel Studios' shared universe, the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU),[68][70][71] though Feige did consider integrating the series with the MCU during development.[72] Instead, X-Men '97 shares continuity with the original series and several other animated Marvel series that were released in the 1990s, including Iron Man (1994–1996), Fantastic Four (1994–1996), Spider-Man (1994–1998), The Incredible Hulk (1996–97) and Silver Surfer (1998);[20][12][73] within Marvel Comics' multiverse, X-Men: The Animated Series exists on Earth-92131.[74] Winderbaum said X-Men '97 would continue the original series' tradition of featuring crossover cameo appearances from the other 1990s series.[73] During Marvel Studios Animation's panel at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con, X-Men '97 and the studio's other animated series were described as being part of the "Marvel Animated Multiverse",[75] and Winderbaum acknowledged that there was potential to connect the series with other MCU properties using the MCU's multiverse.[12]

Work on a second season had begun by July 2022,[42][76] and writing on the second-season finale started by July 2023.[77] Conley and Yonemura returned as directors for the season.[78] By March 2024, DeMayo had finished writing for the second season,[79][80][81] and had began discussing ideas for a potential third season when he was fired by Marvel Studios ahead of the series' premiere. He was not involved in further promotion for the series and missed its red carpet premiere, which The Hollywood Reporter said was unusual for someone working on a Marvel Studios project, "even if they've been shuffled to the side" or replaced by other creatives.[79] Marvel said DeMayo had been fired after an investigation that led to "egregious" findings, which reportedly involved sexual misconduct.[80][81][82][83] According to journalist Jeff Sneider, the investigation found that DeMayo sent photos of himself to several young male staff members that he wanted them to use for inspiration, in which he was "in various states of undress" and posing suggestively; that he had groped an assistant; and that he was being physically and emotionally abusive to staff members.[84][85] An agreement made following DeMayo's exit allowed him to still tweet about the series.[80] Winderbaum praised DeMayo's work on the series and said his departure would not negatively affect work on the third season, which was in development by the end of the month and remained on track to meet its production schedule. The studio was searching for DeMayo's replacement by then.[86][87]

In June 2024, after DeMayo posted gay pride-themed X-Men fan art on his Instagram account, Marvel told him that they would be removing his credits from the second season because of the post.[88] This decision was reportedly based on multiple instances that Marvel viewed as violations of DeMayo's termination agreement, in addition to the fan art post.[80][81][82][85] DeMayo said the breaches of his termination agreement were posts that he had made about the first season while it was being released, along with him participating in a screening of the series at a bar.[89] His lawyer Bryan Freedman said the agreement included "illegal unconscionable items".[83] DeMayo released a video in which he denied reports of his own egregious misconduct and accused crew members and Marvel executives of "egregious prejudicial misconduct" against him, saying others had weaponized his identity as a gay Black man to undermine his work. He listed a series of concerns about crew and executives who worked on the series, and also suggested that his role on the second season had been "aggressively marginalized" before his firing due to concerns that he had expressed about the workplace culture of Marvel's in-development film Blade (2025) while he was working on that project.[89] Matthew Chauncey, a writer on What If...?, was hired in July 2024 to write the third season, replacing DeMayo.[90] The scripts for the second season had reportedly been revised and rewritten by then, with Chauncey overseeing the rewrites.[90][85]

Writing
By April 2022, the Lewalds had seen premises for all 10 episodes and several completed scripts from the first season, as well as the series' bible,[66]: 1:06:17–1:06:32  which confirms that—as with the original series and the comic books—the revival's central ethos is the X-Men are allegories for people who face prejudice and discrimination.[91] Eric Lewald described X-Men '97 as an extension of the original series that the Marvel Studios team had made their own,[65] while Vasquez-Eberhardt said the original series "embraced action, soap opera and serious topics", and the revival would do the same.[2] DeMayo wanted to honor the original series while bringing it into the modern world,[55]: 19:09–19:48  hoping to retain its earnestness, emotional sincerity, and focus on found family while updating the social commentary to reflect contemporary society.[92] The new series explores whether Professor Charles Xavier's dream of mutant/human co-existence and his focus on empathy are still relevant to modern audiences,[27][93] with DeMayo feeling that issues of social acceptance had become more complicated since the 1990s.[27]

The revival begins a year after the loss of Xavier during the original series' finale.[1] Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm, Wolverine, Rogue, Beast, Gambit, and Jubilee return as members of the X-Men, now led by their former adversary Magneto.[28] Joining the team in the first season are Bishop, a time-traveling ally of the X-Men; Morph, who rejoins after their death and resurrection in the original series;[94] and Kurt Wagner / Nightcrawler. Winderbaum said fans remembered these three characters as being more important in the original series than they actually were, and the creatives wanted to make-up for that by elevating them in the revival.[73] The X-Men question their future after Xavier's loss and a subsequent increase in sympathy towards mutants. Cyclops and Storm want to continue Xavier's dream but others, such as Jean Grey, want to build new lives. Magneto is moved by the growing mutant sympathy and wants to follow in Xavier's footsteps as the team's leader.[95] The main antagonists for the first season are the returning Mister Sinister and the Sentinels,[94][96] along with new villain Bastion.[35] Deadpool does not appear in the season because Marvel was saving him for the film Deadpool & Wolverine (2024), though Winderbaum said they could have used him if there was an "insanely compelling reason".[97]

DeMayo said the original series' melodrama and exploration of character relationships was key to its success and set it apart from other animated series at the time,[98] which Marvel executives felt was a compelling approach to the material.[55]: 19:09–19:48  X-Men '97 also retains the campiness of the original series in its writing, such as Storm announcing her attacks and Rogue using "syrupy" Southern metaphors and analogies. DeMayo found it particularly difficult to write for Rogue, who developed in ways that he did not initially plan for throughout the first season; and for Jubilee, who was introduced as a representative for younger audiences in the 1990s and needed to remain relevant for younger audiences in the modern day. DeMayo was more comfortable writing for Beast, whose scientific terms are similar to the writer's work on the series Star Trek: Strange New Worlds (2022–present).[98]

As with the original series, various comic book storylines were adapted for the revival. The Animated Series was primarily influenced by Chris Claremont's run on the comics from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s, and X-Men '97 continues to adapt stories from that era as well as elements from later in the 1990s and into Grant Morrison's early 2000s run.[99] "The Trial of Magneto" from Uncanny X-Men #200 (1985), by Claremont and John Romita Jr., is adapted in the second episode.[91] The third episode is a condensed version of the comic book crossover event "Inferno" (1989).[100] The "Lifedeath" storyline from Uncanny X-Men #186 (1984), by Claremont and Barry Windsor-Smith, is adapted in the fourth and sixth episodes;[100][101] the fourth episode contains two mini-episodes, the first part of "Lifedeath" and also "Motendo" which is an homage to the 1992 X-Men arcade game.[100][102]

Central to DeMayo's pitch for the revival was the idea that the original series was made in a "simple [time] of right and wrong, where questions about identity and social justice had relatively clear cut answers", but the people who grew-up watching the original had since experienced 9/11, a rise in populist movements, the COVID-19 pandemic, and other traumatic events. DeMayo particularly highlighted the 2016 Pulse nightclub shooting which had personally impacted him as a gay man who had partied at that club. He wanted the X-Men to go through a similarly traumatic event and face "the realities of an adult and unsafe world" just like the audience of the original series had, which led to the attack on the mutant nation of Genosha in the fifth episode.[17] This is based on the "E Is for Extinction" storyline from New X-Men #115 (2001) by Morrison and Frank Quitely,[103][104] though the attack is not perpetrated by Cassandra Nova as in that comic.[105] Following the fifth episode, the X-Men have to decide how they will change in response to the attack and whether social healing or social justice is needed.[17] The reveal that Bastion is responsible for the Genosha attack leads to the season's three-part finale, which includes elements from the crossover event "Operation: Zero Tolerance" (1997).[106] The final episodes see the X-Men split into two teams, Blue and Gold, as was done in the 1990s comics. Magneto ripping the adamantium metal from Wolverine's skeleton at the end of the ninth episode was adapted from the crossover event "Fatal Attractions" (1993).[107]

Casting and voice recording




X-Men '97 features several new actors taking on roles from the original series, including Ray Chase as Cyclops, Jennifer Hale as Jean Grey, J. P. Karliak as Morph, and A. J. LoCascio as Gambit
With the revival's announcement, several voice actors were revealed to be returning from the original series: Cal Dodd (Logan / Wolverine), Lenore Zann (Rogue), George Buza (Henry "Hank" McCoy / Beast), Catherine Disher (Jean Grey), Chris Potter (Remy LeBeau / Gambit), Alison Sealy-Smith (Ororo Munroe / Storm), Adrian Hough (Kurt Wagner / Nightcrawler), Christopher Britton (Nathaniel Essex / Mister Sinister), and Alyson Court (Jubilation Lee / Jubilee).[18][56] Lawrence Bayne (Nathan Summers / Cable) and Ron Rubin (Morph) also returned. Dodd, Zann, Buza, Sealy-Smith, Hough, and Britton all reprised their roles from the original series, while the others voice new roles: Disher voices Dr. Valerie Cooper, Potter voices Nathan Summers / Cable, Court voices Abscissa, Bayne voices Carl Denti / X-Cutioner, and Rubin voices President Robert Edward Kelly.[27]

Ray Chase takes on the role of Scott Summers / Cyclops following the death of original voice actor Norm Spencer;[27][108] Jennifer Hale replaces Disher as the voice of Jean Grey;[27] Holly Chou replaces Court as Jubilation Lee / Jubilee, with Court previously stating that she would not return to the role and hoped an Asian-American actor would voice the character instead;[18][27] A. J. LoCascio replaces Potter as Remy LeBeau / Gambit; Matthew Waterson voices Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto, following the death of David Hemblen; Gui Agustini voices Roberto da Costa / Sunspot; J. P. Karliak replaces Rubin as Morph; Isaac Robinson-Smith voices Lucas Bishop, replacing Philip Akin; Ross Marquand voices Professor Charles Xavier, replacing Cedric Smith; Gil Birmingham voices Forge following the death of Marc Strange; and Eric Bauza voices the Sentinels after the death of David Fox.[5][27]

Meredith Layne was the casting and voice director for the series, responsible for casting actors and directing the voice recording sessions. New cast members were hired for instances where the original voice actor was not available or their voice was no longer appropriate for the character, and were intended to match the original performances.[4] Recasting was also done to have more authentic representation (as with Court and Jubilee), because of specific vocal intonations (as with Cable to better highlight the "weird" father-son relationship with Cyclops), or for symbolic reasons (as with Disher now voicing Valerie Cooper). Regarding Disher's new role, DeMayo explained that Cooper delivers the series' thesis and he wanted Disher to be the one to present that since he felt "she was such the heart of the original series" and her original role as Jean Grey was "the epitome of empathy".[27]

In February 2024, DeMayo said Theo James, who DeMayo worked with on the film The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf (2021), had been cast in a "fan favorite" role,[27] later revealed to be Bastion.[35] Reprising their voice roles from What If...? in the first season are Josh Keaton as Steve Rogers / Captain America and Michael Patrick McGill as Thunderbolt Ross.[49] Gates McFadden is introduced at the end of the first season as Mother Askani, a future version of the daughter of Cyclops and Jean Grey. DeMayo and Winderbaum decided to cast McFadden after discussing her performance as Beverly Crusher in the third season of Star Trek: Picard (2023). Winderbaum had felt that Crusher and Jean were similar characters since he had been reading X-Men comics around the same time as the series Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987–1994) was being released, so he thought it was poetic to cast McFadden as a version of Jean's daughter.[109]

Voice recording began by November 2021,[110] primarily taking place remotely over Zoom due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Chase and Hale recorded scenes for the third episode together in-person because of how much dialogue they share in that episode, but they said this was a rare occasion.[4] Dodd revealed in February 2023 that he had started recording for the second season,[111] and Zann stated in August 2023 that she had begun recording for it as well.[112] By May 2024, she had completed her work on the season except for additional dialogue recording (ADR).[113] Bayne also returned for the season.[114] Despite the pandemic having less of an impact on the second season, recording continued to take place remotely for most cast members due to them being based in different locations.[4]

Animation and design
Animation was provided by Studio Mir[115] and Tiger Animation.[116]: 30:52  The 2D animation style of the original series was retained, but "slightly modernized" to improve the quality and reflect advances in animation since the 1990s.[98][65] Castorena's pitch for the job of supervising director was to make the series "fresh, but familiar",[12] and he said it needed to be "the show we remember, but it has to be in 4K".[98] Houston advised the animation team on how the original series was made,[12] and the storyboard artists reviewed the original to inform their composition, editing, and cinematography decisions. Winderbaum said there was a "code of ethics" they followed to align with the restrictions of the 1990s animation, but they occasionally broke this for dramatic effect such as during key action sequences.[98] A VHS-inspired effect was applied to the animation to make it appear more like 1990s television.[12][98] 3D animation was used to lay out scenes and create more complicated vehicles and ships, but the animation team drew over this in 2D to maintain the series's art style.[117] The opening title sequence of The Animated Series was recreated with updated animation for the revival. Houston worked with episodic directors Conley and Yonemura to recreate the title sequence based on Houston's original storyboards.[118]


The character designs for Rogue, Cyclops, Jubilee, and Bishop in X-Men '97, by lead character designer Amelia Vidal. Vidal aimed to retain the designs from the original series and the comic books of the 1970s to the 1990s.[119]
DeMayo said the costumes chosen for each character indicated which comic book storylines were being adapted by the series.[27] Lead character designer Amelia Vidal retained the design concepts from the original series along with the style and aesthetics of the X-Men comic books of the 1970s to the 1990s. Any changes from those were made to either better serve the story or to assist with the technical side of the animation.[119] Nightcrawler's design is based on his appearance during John Byrne and Dave Cockrum's 1970s comic book runs.[119] In the final episodes of the first season, the X-Men don costumes based on their original comic book designs and those of the failed 1989 animation pilot X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men. DeMayo said this was always planned as part of the series' exploration of nostalgia.[120][107] The original series' animators could not move Mister Sinister around much because of his complex design, which includes tendrils coming from his back; this was not an issue for the new series, but the animators chose to restrict the character's movements to align with the original series.[12]

To show emotion with Cyclops, whose eyes and eyebrows are covered by his visor, animators adjusted how the glints and reflections appeared on his visor. Castorena said other mutants' powers were also used in unique ways to convey their emotions,[77] and his goal was to use mutant powers in ways that had not been seen before such as having Gambit charge Wolverine's claws with kinetic energy. Morph's shape-shifting powers allow for cameo appearances of other mutants.[12] A background in the fifth episode features the Watcher in a blink-and-you-miss-it Easter egg for fans. The Watcher was included because that character observes important moments throughout the multiverse, including the massacre in Genosha. Castorena said this was not necessarily the same version of the Watcher that appears in What If...? since a different version of the character also appeared in the original series.[104]

Work on the animatics for the first season had begun by November 2021,[110] and full animation began by April 2023.[121] The first season was in post-production by July,[77] and animatics for the entire second season had been created by March 2024.[86]

Music
One of Feige's stipulations for reviving X-Men: The Animated Series was ensuring Marvel Studios was able to use that series' theme song,[73] which was composed by Ron Wasserman. Wasserman composed the theme while under contract with producer Haim Saban, giving legal ownership of the song to Saban.[122] Following legal battles over the use of the theme, Marvel Studios paid a large sum to secure the rights to it in 2022.[122][123] This was done on the condition that it be re-recorded for future projects and credited to the original series' music executives, Saban and Shuki Levy.[122] Wasserman was set to meet with Marvel about his involvement in the revival by early 2022,[66]: 1:03:07–1:03:27  but John Andrew Grush and Taylor Newton Stewart—known professionally as the Newton Brothers—were announced to be the composers for X-Men '97 that July.[76]

The Newton Brothers were hired while Marvel was still in the process of securing the rights for the original theme. On revisiting the original series, the composers realized that the music did not match with their childhood memories and many of the original synthesizer sounds would now sound dated to modern audiences. They chose to modernize the score with an orchestra, choir, and some modern synthesizers.[124] However, they felt the theme song should remain more true to the original style, to not "ruin the nostalgic vibes" and embrace the sincerity of the original series. They produced eight different versions of the theme, each with a different amount of orchestral music versus synthesizer music, before settling on the final version. The main melody is played on a synthesizer and an electric guitar, the latter performed by Nili Brosh.[125] The X-Men '97 version of the theme, credited to Saban and Levy, was first heard in the MCU film Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022) and then the series Ms. Marvel (2022) when those projects referenced mutants.[126]

After discussing the score's tone with DeMayo, the Newton Brothers decided to begin closer to the original series and modernize the music more with each episode. They began by experimenting with ideas separately and then came together to write musical suites for each main character, defining sounds and instruments which could be their "calling cards". For instance, Storm's music uses woodwind instruments, choir, and chanting to reflect the wind aspect of her powers, while a waterphone and other metallic sounds were used for Magneto.[124] To ensure the music did not become too modern, the composers took influence from 1990s musicians such as Michael Jackson, the Prodigy, Radiohead, and Depeche Mode.[122][127] Jackson's "Thriller" particularly inspired the third episode,[127] which "got the Gothic treatment" and includes an organ.[128] The song "Happy Nation" by Ace of Base, which was released days after X-Men: The Animated Series premiered in 1992, is used prominently in the series in relation to the nation of Genosha and the Sentinel attack on it.[129]

The X-Men '97 version of the main theme was released by Marvel Music and Hollywood Records as a digital single on March 20, 2024.[130] The next month, Stewart confirmed that he and Grush were returning for the second season but said they had not yet begun writing music for it.[131] A full soundtrack album for the first season was released on May 24. All music composed by the Newton Brothers:[132]

The series was discussed during Marvel Studios Animation's panel at the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con, where animatics were shown.[42] Completed animation from the series was shown a year later at the 2023 San Diego Comic-Con, where Hasbro's Marvel Legends figures for the series were also revealed.[94] In December 2023, Marvel Comics announced a four-issue comic book prequel series, also titled X-Men '97, written by Steve Foxe and with art by Salva Espin. The comic was made in collaboration with the series' producers. Foxe said the comic was an "original tale that feeds right into" the new series.[133] The first issue was released in March 2024.[134] Foxe and Espin previously worked on X-Men '92, a comic book continuation of the original series.[133] Select X-Men comic books released in March 2024 feature variant covers based on Hasbro's Marvel Legends figures for the series.[135]

A trailer for the series was released on February 15, 2024, when the first season's premiere date was announced.[27] Charles Pulliam-Moore at The Verge and Joshua Rivera at Polygon both praised the trailer's nostalgia for the original series and specifically focused on the use of the original series' main theme.[136][137] Ben Travis, writing for Empire, also noted the nostalgia and music as well as the "narrative weight" suggested by the trailer's character details.[138] James Whitbrook at Gizmodo felt something was off about the trailer and identified that the animation "flits between looking oddly flat and stilted and some elements that almost look 3D", along with the combination of new and returning voice actors. However, he liked the series' aesthetic and some of the story ideas suggested by the trailer, and hoped that the elements which made him uneasy would work better when actually watching the series.[139] The trailer reportedly set an internal Disney record as the biggest trailer launch for a Disney+ animated series, surpassing the trailers for What If...? and the service's Star Wars animated series.[140]

Arcade1Up announced a home arcade cabinet, themed around X-Men '97, later in February. It features eight Marvel/Capcom video games: X-Men: Mutant Apocalypse (1994), Marvel Super Heroes (1995), X-Men: Children of the Atom (1995), X-Men vs. Street Fighter (1996), Marvel Super Heroes in War of the Gems (1996), Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter (1997), Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes (1998), and Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes (2000).[141] The titles for each episode of the first season were announced on a poster done in the style of a 1990s issue of TV Guide.[101] The first three episodes debuted at the series' world premiere in Hollywood, Los Angeles, on March 13.[79][142] By the end of the month, viewership for all five seasons of the original series had increased on Disney+ by 522 percent since the release of the trailer in February.[143]

Release
X-Men '97 premiered on Disney+ on March 20, 2024, with its first two episodes. The rest of the ten-episode first season was released weekly until May 15.[53] The season was originally scheduled for release in late 2023.[42]

Reception
Viewership
According to Whip Media, which tracks viewership data for the 25 million worldwide users of its TV Time app, X-Men '97 was the most anticipated new series of March 2024.[144] Disney announced that the first two episodes had 4 million views worldwide in the five days following their release, marking the biggest first-season premiere for a full-length animated series on the service since the first season of What If...? in 2021.[145][146] The company announced that the first-season finale was watched by 3.5 million views globally during its first five days, which was similarly the biggest season finale for a full-length animated series on the streaming service since the first season of What If...? Disney added that viewership had grown consistently over the four episodes leading up to the finale, and views for the original series had also doubled since X-Men '97 premiered.[146]

The series debuted on Whip's US top streaming originals chart in fourth place during its premiere week. It was in third place, behind Amazon Prime Video's Invincible and Disney+'s Star Wars: The Bad Batch, for the next two weeks; in second place, behind Prime Video's Fallout, for the following three weeks; and at first place for the two weeks after that. For the week that the first-season finale was released, the series was second on Whip's chart behind Netflix's Bridgerton.[147] JustWatch, a guide to streaming content with access to data from more than 20 million users, included X-Men '97 on its list of top 10 US streaming series for the week it premiered.[148]

Critical response
[icon]
This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (March 2024)
The first season received critical acclaim,[90][149][150] was called "Marvel's best release in years", and was praised for its nostalgic animation, "smart writing, and captivating action sequences".[151][152] Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes calculated that 99% of 79 critics reviews were positive, with an average rating of 8.9 out of 10. The website's critics consensus reads, "Pulling off the x-traordinary feat of staying true to its beloved predecessor while charting a path forward for the franchise, X-Men '97 is simply x-cellent."[153] Metacritic assigned a weighted average score of 82 out of 100 based on 14 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".[154]

Hayden Mears of TVLine complimented the show for combining the "vintage" feel with modernity in an "unassuming way".[155] Francis Agustin of the BBC believed that the series was a shift away from the heavily interconnected Marvel Cinematic Universe.[156] Alex Abad-Santos of Vox said "[e]verything about '97 reflects an affection and thoughtfulness, not just for the Saturday morning cartoon but for the X-Men, too", praising the show for its understanding of the source material.[157] Brian Lowry of CNN News commented on the series' more adult tone and noted how it managed to remain faithful to the original series in spite of it.[158] Simon Gallagher from Screen Rant said "27 years after The Animated Series ended, X-Men '97 takes the original further, adding freshness without betraying anything that made us love it" and praising the show for its story, chosen plots and improved animation style.[159]
