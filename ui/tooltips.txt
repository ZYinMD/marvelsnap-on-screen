Marvel Cinematic Universe:
With [] movies and [] TV series set in the same world, MCU is the biggest continuity of all.

20th Century Fox X-Men universe:
20th Century Fox bought film rights of X-Men characters from Marvel in the 90s, then made 13 movies set in the same world.
After being acquired by Disney in 2019, no new titles are to be added to this continuity. Future development of X-Men stories will likely happen in the MCU.
The Fantastic 4 characters share the same history (sold to 20th Century Fox then returned to MCU after Disney acquisition) but the Fantastic 4 movies did not happen in the X-Men universe.


live-action-tv-series:
All but 3 of these series happen in the MCU. Some of them are tightly integrated with the feature films

animated-tv-series:
The Big Hero 6 and Baymax series are not included because they didn't appear in MarvelSnap.
The What If... series are not included due to the unique nature of the series.

It's really simpler than you think:
- All MCU stories happen in the same world. (20+ movies, 10+ season of TV series, from 2008 to preset)
- All X-men movies happen in the same world. (13 movies)
- All other movies happen in their own universe, with no continuity between one another.

Film rights to X-men characters and Fantastic Four characters:
- In 1995, Marvel sold these characters to 20 Century Fox, who made 16 movies out of them. 13 X-men and 3 Fantastic Four.

Film rights to Spider-Man characters & Venom, Ghost Rider, Morbius, Kraven:
- In 1999, Marvel sold these characters to SONY, who has made many movies over the years, and will continue to make new ones, but these are all standalone series that' don't happen in the same world.
- Since 2015, SONY had a deal with Marvel on Spider-Man: Marvel can use Spider-Man in Avenger movies, which they did 4 times, while SONY can use any MCU characters in making Spider-Man movies,
